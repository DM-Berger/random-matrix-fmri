    authors to ensure that their pdf article file is readable, complete and
    that figures are legible and properly placed.

    is suitable (e.g. excel files, txt files) and should not exceed 100Mb. See

    "You can format your paper in the way that you choose! It is not necessary
    to try to produce pages that look like published journal pages, as the
    detailed design (typesetting) work will be undertaken by IOP as part of the
    production process.  If you would prefer to work from a template, we do
    provide this for both LaTeX and Word.  When submitting a new article, we
    only require you to upload a single PDF file (and any relevant
    supplementary data)"
