To the Editors of Network Neuroscience

We believe our manuscript \emph{Random Matrix Theory Tools for the Analysis of Functional Magnetic
Resonance Imaging Examinations} would be an excellent fit for Network Neuroscience as a
\emph{Research} article. Our use of random matrix theory (RMT) for the analysis of functional
connectivity in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) falls clearly within the \href{https://direct.mit.edu/netn/pages/submission-guidelines#aims}{Aims and Scope}
of \emph{Network Neuroscience}.


To the best of our knowledge, our voxelwise analysis of fMRI using RMT features is novel\(\mathbf{^{[1]}}\): the RMT
features computed here summarize the correlations of \emph{all} fMRI voxels (rather than those from
some seed voxels), but previous works (documented in the manuscript) have been ROI focused. We also
present results in a predictive framework using cross-validation on a wide variety of datasets,
which we believe is more rigorous than an approach based solely on statistical significance for a
single dataset. Given there are very few uses of RMT for fMRI analysis, we hope you will find this
manuscript to be worth your while.

Should you consider to review our manuscript, we believe the following reviewers would be suitable:
