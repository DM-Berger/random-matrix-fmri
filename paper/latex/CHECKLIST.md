# Before Submitting

The following is a brief checklist of important issues to address before submitting to Network Neuroscience:

- [x]  Think about whether your article fits with the Aims and Scope of the journal.
- []   On first submission we require a brief cover letter that should comment on your article’s significance and
  fit with the journal.
- [x]  Be ready to certify that your article represents original work and that there is no
  significant overlap with any other articles by the authors that are under consideration or in
  press elsewhere. Related submissions at other journals should be brought to the attention of the
  Editor. Note that publication of preprints on servers such as arXiv and bioRxiv is acceptable and
  encouraged.
- [x]  The abstract is limited to 200 words, and titles should be concise (no more than 350
  characters). Please provide a short title (no more than 70 characters) as well.
- []   Prepare a list of up to 6 keywords.
- []   Prepare a list of at least 3 potential reviewers. Be sure to avoid conflicts of interest.
- []   Confirm that all co-authors approve the manuscript in its submitted form. Collect their
  names, affiliations, email addresses and funding information.
- []   Be ready to enter author contributions, which are required for all Research, Methods, and
  Data Articles.
- []   On first submission, articles can use any formatting the author chooses and can be submitted
  as a single pdf file. Please be sure to integrate all figures and tables into the main text and
  prepare a pdf that is legible and facilitates the review process. Consider including line
  numbering.
- []   Be ready to declare any competing interests for yourself and all co-authors.
- []   Be sure all authors agree that your article will be published under a Creative Commons
  Attribution (CC BY) license, which allows free and unlimited reuse of articles without permission
  or fees.
- []   Be sure all authors of reprinted figures or text agree that your article will be published
  under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license, which allows free and unlimited reuse of
  articles without permission or fees.
- []    If you plan to publish data sets or tools, please cite these materials in the text of your
  article and include entries for them in your references list. Either enclose them with your
  submission (if less than ≤100Mb) or include a link to a public repository where the materials can
  be accessed. We strongly recommend that when materials are not to be hosted by the journal, you
  place them in a repository with a robust persistence policy that will register and supply you with
  a persistent identifier like a DOI. Include this persistent ID in your reference listing. See
  Accessibility of Data and Other Materials below.
- []   Pre-submission posting of articles online, e.g. by using the arXiv or bioRxiv preprint
  servers, is encouraged. We regard dissemination of preprints as an important step to make research
  more accessible and accelerate progress in the field. This practice will not affect judgements of
  novelty or originality of the submitted work.

First Submission

On first submission, Network Neuroscience does not require any specific formatting, including formatting of references. All articles are uploaded as a single pdf document with all elements of the article fully integrated (including figures, tables and references). It is the responsibility of the authors to ensure that their pdf article file is readable, complete and that figures are legible and properly placed.

Supplementary Materials can be supplied as pdf files or any file type that is suitable (e.g. excel files, txt files) and should not exceed 100Mb. See Accessibility of Data and Other Materials below for more information.

Regarding formatting of the article, we suggest the following general guidelines:

    The text (including all formulas and mathematical symbols) should be typed so as to be easily legible and properly spaced.
    Figures and tables may be placed anywhere in the text. Most reviewers prefer that figures and tables are placed close to where they are first referenced.
    Figures should be supplied at a suitable resolution, with labels that are legible and properly sized.
    Corresponding figure legends and figures should be placed on the same page.
    All pages should be numbered consecutively. In addition, we strongly suggest line numbering as well.
    References can be in any citation style but must be complete and should be consistently formatted. Citation of papers that are “in press” or “submitted”, or otherwise inaccessible, is not permitted. Note that references will need to follow the American Psychological Association format at the Revision stage (see below).
    Your cover letter can help in editorial decision making. It should address how the article provides an important scientific or methodological advance and why it fits within the aims and scope of the journal.

Network Neuroscience requires that the specific contributions of all authors are identified. On submission, you will be asked to enter author contributions using a Credit Taxonomy tool within the submission system.
