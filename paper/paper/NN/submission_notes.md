# Network Neuroscience

## Submission General Instructions

- On first submission, **Network Neuroscience does not require any specific
  formatting, including formatting of references**. All articles are uploaded
  as a single pdf document with all elements of the article fully integrated
  (including figures, tables and references).
- LaTeX template provided later
- All articles should provide a list of Technical Terms which is uploaded as a
  separate document (pdf). This list should comprise around 10 key terms that
  are mentioned in the article and whose usage and definition may not be
  familiar across the broad readership of the journal. Authors should provide
  brief (20 words or less) definitions for each of these terms, avoiding in
  these definitions the use of jargon, or highly technical or specialized
  language. Technical Terms will appear in the margins of the article at or
  near their first mention in the text. Please upload Technical Terms as a
  separate file.

### Article Types

- Research
  - Principal article type in Network Neuroscience. Covers original
    research that is of broad interest and high significance to the field.
    Research articles must employ rigorous empirical and analytic methodology
    and provide substantial support for their conclusions. They should be
    written in a style that is accessible to a broad audience of scientists
    interested in neurobiological networks
  - no strict overall word limit, authors should aim for a maximum length of
    around 6000 words total (excluding references). The Introduction and
    Discussion sections may not exceed 800 and 1600 words, respectively. All
    non-essential material should be provided as Supplementary Materials. 
- Methods
  - describe novel experimental or computational/analytic methods and tools
    that advance the goals of network neuroscience. Methods articles should
    provide detailed protocols for method implementation and strive to
    establish the validity of new methodologies. Authors of Methods articles
    are required to supply new materials, data and analytic tools covered in
    the article freely and openly to the scientific community.
  - the Introduction and Discussion sections are limited to 800 and 1600 words,
    respectively, and the total article length should not exceed 6000 words.
    Avoid reproducing code as part of the main text. Methods articles must
    include all essential materials needed to apply the method (full
    experimental procedures or software tools) as part of the Supplementary
    Materials or through a permanent link (URL or DOI) in a public repository
- Data
- Review
- Perspective

#### Research articles

We prefer that the Methods section be placed at the end of the manuscript
(after the Discussion). However, we will also accept articles that place the
Methods between the Introduction and the Results, if authors consider this
ordering to be more suitable for their manuscript. Research articles should
generally be arranged as follows:

1. Title/Authors/Affiliations/Contact Information/Keywords
2. Abstract
3. Author Summary (Research and Focus articles only)
4. Introduction
5. Results
6. Discussion
7. Materials and Methods (alternatively titled Methods, Models or Theory, as appropriate)
8. Acknowledgements
9. References


## Annoyances

- The abstract is limited to 200 words, and titles should be concise (no more
  than 350 characters). Please provide a short title (no more than 70
  characters) as well
- Prepare a list of at least 3 potential reviewers. Be sure to avoid conflicts
  of interest
- Be ready to enter author contributions, which are required for all Research,
  Methods, and Data Articles
- Footnotes, endnotes and appendices are not permitted.
- This gold OA journal charges an APC (Article Processing Charge) of $1,750 per
  article which will be billed upon acceptance of the manuscript
