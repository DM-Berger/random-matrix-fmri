# MRI - Magnetic Resonance Imaging

**These people are incompetent, not worth the time**

- need cover letter
- 100% contradictory information about whether they want a single file or multiple files
    - actual submission portal (https://www.editorialmanager.com/magresimaging/default1.aspx) asks for one file
        - but when you do, you ACTUALLY NEED 4 FILES:
          1. Manuscript
          2. Cover Letter
          3. Abstract
          4. Title Page
          5. +supplementary material
    - "Authors are requested to submit the text, tables, and artwork in electronic form (not as a PDF) to this address [...] The preferred order of files is as follows: cover letter, suggested reviewers, response to reviews (revised manuscripts only), manuscript file(s), table(s), figure(s). Files should be labeled with appropriate and descriptive file names (e.g., SmithText.doc, Fig1.eps, Table3.doc). Upload text, tables and graphics as separate files.  Do not import figures or tables into the text document and **do not upload your text as a PDF**. Complete instructions for electronic artwork submission can be found on the Author Gateway, accessible through the journal home page.
      - there is no Author Gateway on the journal home page

- use https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/elsarticle article class (included by default) and BibTeX
    - https://www.elsevier.com/authors/policies-and-guidelines/latex-instructions for full LaTeX instructions
- a bunch of structure requirements, not too bad
