## Instructions 

> We now differentiate between the requirements for new and revised
> submissions. You may choose to submit your manuscript as a single Word or PDF
> file to be used in the refereeing process. Only when your paper is at the
> revision stage, will you be requested to put your paper in to a 'correct

> your article.

As part of the Your Paper Your Way service, you may choose to submit your
manuscript as a single file to be used in the refereeing process. This can be a
PDF file or a Word document, in any format or lay-out that can be used by
referees to evaluate your manuscript. It should contain high enough quality
figures for refereeing. If you prefer to do so, you may still provide all or
some of the source files at the initial submission. Please note that individual
figure files larger than 10 MB must be uploaded separately.

**In general submission format is very relaxed 

### Other Annoyances

- If the study involves the re-analysis of previously published datasets (from
  the author or other groups) or public/shared datasets, the ethics statement
  should describe both the original ethical review as well as any further
  ethical review or data use agreement pertinent to the submitted manuscript.
- **Authors must state in their cover letter if a brief version of the study has
  been published as a conference proceeding.** In this case, the Authors should
  clarify the additional work that has been completed and added to the
  submitted full report. The proceeding paper must be available to the
  editorial team in order to judge the relative novelty and contribution of the
  full paper.
