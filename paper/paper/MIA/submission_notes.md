## File Formats

- Journal Specific LaTeX TemplateTemplates are provided in order to allow
  authors to view their paper in a style close to the finalprinted form.The
  latex template can be found here.
- It is important that the file be saved in the native format of the
  wordprocessor used. The text shouldbe in single-column format. Keep the
  layout of the text as simple as possible. Most formatting codeswill be
  removed and replaced on processing the article. In particular, do not use the
  wordprocessor'soptions  to  justify text  or  to  hyphenate  words.
- However, do  use  bold  face,  italics, subscripts,superscripts etc. When
  preparing tables, if you are using a table grid, use only one grid for
  eachindividual table and not a grid for each row.  If no grid is used, use
  tabs, not spaces, to align columns.The electronic text should be prepared in
  a way very similar to that of conventional manuscripts (seealso the Guide to
  Publishing with Elsevier: https://www.elsevier.com/guidepublication).
- Supplementary material such as applications, images and sound clips, can be
  published with yourarticle to enhance it. Submitted supplementary items are
  published exactly as they are received (Excelor PowerPoint files will appear
  as such online).

## Annoyances

- Editable files (e.g., Word, LaTeX) are required to typeset your article
  forfinal publication.
- Please provide 3 to 5 names (with e-mail addresses) of potential reviewers
  with whom you have had no recent collaboration and no conflict of interest
  (during the last 5 years). Although not mandatory,neglecting this point often
  reveals a lack of knowledge in the field of research, and might slow downthe
  reviewing process.
