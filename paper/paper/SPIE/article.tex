% Purpose:
% Data-intensive modeling could provide insight on the broad variability in outcomes in
% spine surgery. Previous studies were limited to analysis of demographic and clinical
% characteristics. We report an analytic framework called “SpineCloud” that incorporates
% quantitative features extracted from perioperative images to predict spine surgery outcome.

% Approach:
% A retrospective study was conducted in which patient demographics, imaging, and outcome
% data were collected. Image features were automatically computed from perioperative CT.
% Postoperative 3- and 12-month functional and pain outcomes were analyzed in terms of improvement
% relative to the preoperative state. A boosted decision tree classifier was trained to predict
% outcome using demographic and image features as predictor variables. Predictions were computed
% based on SpineCloud and conventional demographic models, and features associated with poor outcome
% were identified from weighting terms evident in the boosted tree.

% Results
% Neither approach was predictive of 3- or 12-month outcomes based on preoperative data
% alone in the current, preliminary study. However, SpineCloud predictions incorporating image
% features obtained during and immediately following surgery (i.e., intraoperative and immediate
% postoperative images) exhibited significant improvement in area under the receiver operating
% characteristic (AUC): AUC=0.72 (CI95=0.59 to 0.83) at 3 months and AUC=0.69 (CI95=0.55
% to 0.82) at 12 months.

% Conclusions Predictive modeling of lumbar spine surgery outcomes was improved by incorporation of
% image-based features compared to analysis based on conventional demographic data. The SpineCloud
% framework could improve understanding of factors underlying outcome variability and warrants
% further investigation and validation in a larger patient cohort.

\section*{Purpose}
Random matrix theory (RMT) is an increasingly useful tool for understanding large, complex systems.
Prior studies have examined functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scans using tools from
RMT, with some success. However, RMT computations are complex, and sensitive to numerous analytic
choices, and previous investigations have been mostly explanatory / descriptive. We systematically
investigate the usefulness of RMT in a variety of fMRI datasets in a predictive framework.

\section*{Approach}
We develop open-source software to efficiently compute RMT features from fMRI images, and examine
the cross-validated predictive potential of eigenvalue and RMT-based features ("eigenfeatures") used
with typical classificatory machine-learning algorithms. We systematically vary pre-processing extent,
normalization procedure, RMT unfolding procedure, and classifiers to examine the utility of these
eigenfeatures across various datasets.

\section*{Results}
We find eiegenfeatures to be broadly predictive in a wide variety of contexts, and that RMT-specific
features like the spectral rigidity and level number variance have considerable potential in
feature-engineering for fMRI. On median, we find ... However, we also find the utility of the
extracted eigenfeatures to depend strongly and complexly on various analytic decisions.

\section*{Conclusions}
Consider using RMT.

\section{Introduction}

% journal. Note that this template is only intended to be used as a guideline for author convenience.

In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), changes in the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent
(BOLD) signals are related to neural activity. It is common to investigate statistical relationships
between the BOLD signals through \textbf{functional connectivity} analyses, where correlations between
collections of these signals are examined to infer connections between different voxels or regions
of interest (ROIs) within the brain.

Whether in the presence of experimental stimuli, or the relative absence, as in a resting state,
complex functional connectivity networks are ubiquitous
\citenum{bucknerBrainDefaultNetwork2008,foxCoverHumanBrain2005,gonzalez-castilloTaskbasedDynamicFunctional2018,hermundstadStructuralFoundationsRestingstate2013}.
This complexity suggests fMRI is a candidate to be studied using \textbf{Random Matrix Theory} (RMT), a set
of mathematical tools originally developed some 50 years ago to solve complex problems in nuclear
physics \citenum{guhrRandommatrixTheoriesQuantum1998a,mehtaRandomMatrices2004}. In various
physical systems where nuclei can have different possible states, precisely modeling the entirety of
the interactions between nuclei is often intractable. For such large, complex systems, the
eigenvalues (or spectra) efficiently summarize the totality of the interactions between components
of the system, and RMT describes the expected behaviour of such eigenvalues. By analysing the
spectrum statistically, complex systems can be investigated by comparison to the universal
properties predicted by RMT.

In recent years, RMT analyses have been applied to study brain functioning.  The earliest  study
demonstrated that spectra of the correlations between electroencephalographic (EEG) signals closely
resemble those of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) \citenum{sebaRandomMatrixAnalysis2003}.
Somewhat more recently, RMT was used to evaluate the quality of whole brain features extracted from
fMRI data \citenum{voultsidouFeatureEvaluationFMRI2007,verganiRestingStateFMRI2019}. RMT has also
been used in diffusion MRI to aid in the selection of the number of components to employ in
principal-component reduction analysis and denoising
\citenum{veraartDenoisingDiffusionMRI2016,verganiRestingStateFMRI2019,ulfarssonDimensionEstimationNoisy2008}.

Finally, RMT has been used in ROI-based fMRI functional-connectivity studies to investigate
differences between rest and task states \citenum{wangSpectralPropertiesTemporal2015}, between
subjects with and without ADHD \citenum{wangRandomMatrixTheory2016}, and between pain and non-pain
states \citenum{matharooSpontaneousBackpainAlters2020}. Across these three studies, the spectra of
resting or low-attention states exhibited properties closest to the GOE. These findings suggest that
certain aspects of psychological processes might be characterized, in part, by features computed
from the eigenvalues of fMRI correlation matrices, and that these features might vary in an
interpretable manner across psychological processes. If this is the case, RMT could have unique
potential in characterizing the functioning of the human brain.

\section{Datasets}

As our primary intention is to examine the potential utility of RMT-derived features across a wide
variety of data, and not to decisively put forward or refute any specific hypotheses relating RMT to
psychological processes, we examine a wide selection of fMRI datasets available on the
\href{https://openneuro.org/}{OpenNeuro} platform [36].  This allows for a broad assessment of the
potential of voxelwise RMT features.

However, since previous studies employing RMT for feature extraction have partially interpreted
their findings with respect to attentional processes
\citenum{wangRandomMatrixTheory2016,matharooSpontaneousBackpainAlters2020}, we have elected to use
datasets that involve attention in some way. This includes measures of attention or vigilance, or
comparisons between a condition involving more attention and focus (e.g. a task state) or conditions
which should involve considerably less attention or focus (e.g. resting-state).

Dataset scan parameters and acquisition details are summarized in Table \ref{table:1}, and sample
and subgroup sizes are summarized in Table \ref{table:2}. For all datasets, we use the raw
(unpreprocessed) scans, and perform our own preprocessing (detailed later). Given the complexity of
these datasets, we highlight below only those aspects relevant to the current paper.

\section{Parts of Manuscript}

This section describes the normal structure of a manuscript and how each part should be handled. The appropriate vertical spacing between various parts of this document is achieved in LaTeX through the proper use of defined constructs, such as \verb|\section{}|.

\subsection{Title and Author Information}
\label{sect:title}
The article title appears left justified at the top of the first page. The title font is 16 pt., bold. The rules for capitalizing the title are the same as for sentences; only the first word, proper nouns, and acronyms should be capitalized. Do not begin titles with articles (for example, a, an, the) or prepositions (for example, on, by, etc.). The word ``novel'' should not appear in the title, as publication will imply novelty. Avoid the use of acronyms in the title, unless they are widely understood. Appendix A contains more about acronyms.

The list of authors immediately follows the title, 18 points below. The font is 12 pt., bold and the author names are left justified. The author affiliations and addresses follow the names, in 10-pt., normal font and left justified. For multiple affiliations, each affiliation should appear on a separate line. Superscript letters (a, b, c, etc.) should be used to associate multiple authors with their respective affiliations. The corresponding author should be identified with an asterisk, and that person's email address should be provided below the keywords.

\subsection{Abstract}
The abstract should be a summary of the paper and not an introduction. Because the abstract may be used in abstracting journals, it should be self-contained (i.e., no numerical references) and substantive in nature, presenting concisely the objectives, methodology used, results obtained, and their significance. Please note that the following journals require the use of structured abstracts in manuscript submissions: \textit{Neurophotonics}, the \textit{Journal of Biomedical Optics}, and the\textit{ Journal of Medical Imaging}. Structured abstracts are encouraged for the \textit{Journal of Micro/Nanolithography, MEMS, and MOEMS}. Helpful guidelines for structured abstracts are available on the website of the journal.

\subsection{Subject terms/Keywords}
Keywords are required. Please provide 3-6 keywords related to your paper.

\subsection{Body of Paper}
The body of the paper consists of numbered sections that present the main findings. These sections should be organized to best present the material.

To provide transition elements in your paper, it is important to refer back (or forward) to specific sections. Such references are made by indicating the section number, for example, ``In Sec.\ 2 we showed...'' or ``Section 2.1 contained a description...'' If the word Section, Reference, Equation, or Figure starts a sentence, it is spelled out. When occurring in the middle of a sentence, these words are abbreviated Sec., Ref., Eq., and Fig.

At the first occurrence of an acronym, spell it out followed by the acronym in parentheses, for example, charge-coupled diode (CCD).

\subsection{Footnotes}
Textual footnotes should be used rarely to present important documentary or explanatory material whose inclusion in the text would be distracting.\footnote{Example of a footnote.} Due to problems with HTML display, use of footnotes should generally be avoided. If absolutely necessary, the footnote mark must come at the end of a sentence. To insert a footnote, use the {\verb|\footnote{}|} command.

\subsection{Appendices}
Brief appendices may be included when necessary, such as derivations of equations, proofs of theorems, and details of algorithms. Equations and figures appearing in appendices should continue sequential numbering from earlier in the paper.

\subsection{Disclosures}
Conflicts of interest should be declared under a separate header, above Acknowledgments. If the authors have no competing interests to declare, then a statement should be included declaring no conflicts of interest. For assistance generating a disclosure statement, see the form available from  the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors website: \linkable{http://www.icmje.org/conflicts-of-interest/}

\subsection{Acknowledgments}
Acknowledgments and funding information should be added after the conclusion, and before references. Include grant numbers and the full name of the funding body. The acknowledgments section does not have a section number.

\subsection{Data, Materials, and Code Availability}
Availability of data, materials, and/or code used in the research results reported in the manuscript may be declared under the heading "Data, Materials, and Code Availability," following the Acknowledgments section. As relevant, provide specific access information or restrictions for data, materials, and computer code (i.e., links to repository access addresses with guidance on commercial or public access).

\subsection{References}
The References section lists books, articles, and reports that are cited in the paper. This section does not have a section number. The references are numbered in the order in which they are cited. Examples of the format to be followed are given at the end of this document.

The reference list at the end of this document is created using BibTeX, which looks through the file {\ttfamily report.bib} for the entries cited in the LaTeX source file.  The format of the reference list is determined by the bibliography style file {\ttfamily spiejour.bst}, as specified in the \\ \verb|\bibliographystyle{spiejour}| command.  Alternatively, the references may be directly formatted in the LaTeX source file.

For books\cite{Lamport94,Alred03,Goossens97} the listing includes the list of authors (initials plus last name), book title (in italics), page or chapter numbers, publisher, city, and year of publication.  Journal-article references \cite{Metropolis53,Harris06} include the author list, title of the article (in quotes), journal name (in italics, properly abbreviated), volume number (in bold), inclusive page numbers or citation identifier, and year.  A reference to a proceedings paper or a chapter in an edited book\cite{Gull89a} includes the author list, title of the article (in quotes), conference name (in italics), editors (if appropriate), volume title (in italics), volume number if applicable (in bold), inclusive page numbers, publisher, city, and year.  References to an article in the SPIE Proceedings may include the conference name, as shown in Ref.~\citenum{Hanson93c}.

The references are numbered in the order of their first citation. Citations to the references are made using superscripts, as demonstrated in the preceding paragraph. One may also directly refer to a reference within the text, for example, ``as shown in Ref.~\citenum{Metropolis53} ...''  Two or more references should be separated by a comma with no space between them. Multiple sequential references should be displayed with a dash between the first and last numbers \cite{Alred03,Perelman97,Lamport94,Goossens97,Metropolis53}.

\subsubsection{Reference linking and DOIs}
A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is a unique alphanumeric string assigned to a digital object, such as a journal article or a book chapter, that provides a persistent link to its location on the internet. The use of DOIs allows readers to easily access cited articles. Authors should include the DOI at the end of each reference in brackets if a DOI is available. See examples at the end of this manuscript. A free DOI lookup service is available from CrossRef at \\\linkable{http://www.crossref.org/freeTextQuery/}. The inclusion of DOIs will facilitate reference linking and is highly recommended.

In the present LaTeX template, the author needs to add the DOI reference by including it in a ``note'' in the bibliography file, as shown in the file {\verb+report.bib+}, for example, \\ {\verb+note = "[doi:10.1117/12.154577]"+}. The DOI may be used by the reader to locate that document with the link: {\verb+http://dx.doi.org10.1117/12.154577+}.

\subsection{Biographies}
A brief professional biography of approximately 75 words may be provided for each author, if available. Biographies should be placed at the end of the paper, after the references. Personal information such as hobbies or birthplace/birthdate should not be included. Author photographs are not published.

\section{Section Formatting}
\label{sect:sections}
In LaTeX, a new section is created with the \verb|\section{}| command, which automatically numbers the sections. Sections will be numbered sequentially, starting with the first section after the abstract, except for the acknowledgments and references. (Note that numbering of section headings is not required, but the numbering must be consistent if used.) All section headings should be left justified.

Main section headings are in 12-pt. bold font, left-justified and in title case, where important words are capitalized.

Paragraphs that immediately follow a section heading are leading paragraphs and should not be indented, according to standard publishing style. The same goes for leading paragraphs of subsections and sub-subsections. Subsequent paragraphs are standard paragraphs, with 0.2-in (5 mm) indentation. There is no additional space between paragraphs. In LaTeX, paragraphs are separated by blank lines in the source file. Indentation of the first line of a paragraph may be avoided by starting it with \verb|\noindent|.

\subsection{Subsection Headings}
All important words in a subsection (level 1) header are capitalized. Subsection numbers consist of the section number, followed by a period, and the subsection number within that section, without a period at the end. The heading is left justified and its font is 12 pt. italic.

\subsubsection{Sub-subsection headings}
The first word of a sub-subsection is capitalized. The rest of the text is not capitalized, except for proper names and acronyms (the latter should only be used if well known). The heading is left justified and its font is 11 pt. italic.

\section{Figures and Tables}

\subsection{Figures}

Figures are numbered in the order in which they are called out in the text. They should appear in the document in numerical order and as close as possible to their first reference in the text. It may be necessary to move figures or tables around to enhance readability. LaTeX will attempt to place figures at the top or bottom of a page in which they are first referenced.

Figures, along with their captions, should be separated from the main text by  0.2 in.\ or 5 mm and centered. Figure captions are centered below the figure or graph. Figure captions start with the abbreviation ``Fig'' in front of the figure number, followed by a period, and the text in 10-pt. font. See Fig.~\ref{fig:example} for an example.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c}
\includegraphics[height=5.5cm]{mcr3b.eps}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption
{ \label{fig:example}
Example of a figure caption. }
\end{figure}

Authors may wish to create figures consisting of two or more images, in which case, they should be neatly arranged in a rectangular array.  In no case, should the article's text be wrapped around a figure. Figure~\ref{fig:example2} shows two side-by-side images. When a figure contains more than one image, the author must submit them as a single image file. Further details about figure formatting can be found in the author guidelines for each specific SPIE journal: \\
\linkable {https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-authors}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c}
\includegraphics[height=5.5cm]{fig2.eps}  % fig2 includes two images

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption
{ \label{fig:example2}
Example of a figure containing multiple images: (a) sun and (b) blob. Figures containing multiple images must be submitted to SPIE as a single image file.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tables}
Tables are numbered in the order in which they are referenced. They should appear in the document in numerical order and as close as possible to their first reference in the text. It is preferable to have tables appear at the top or bottom of the page, if possible. Table captions are handled identically to those for figures, except that they appear above the table. See Table~\ref{tab:fonts} for an example.

\subsection{Multimedia}
Acceptable file formats, including MOV (.mov), MPEG (.mpg), and MP4 (.mp4), are playable using standard media players, such as VLC or Windows Media Player. The recommended maximum size for each multimedia file is 10-12 MB. Authors must insert a representative still image from the video file in the manuscript as a figure. The caption label will be linked by the publisher to the actual video file. The video may also be mentioned in an existing figure caption. Multimedia files are treated in the same manner as figures and they will be numbered sequentially with normal figures.  The video number, file type, and file size should be included in parentheses at the end of the figure caption. See Figure \ref{vid:satellite} for an example.

\begin{video}
\begin{center}
{\includegraphics[height=5cm]{satellite.eps}}
\\
\end{center}
\caption{\label{vid:satellite}This satellite is a still image from Video 1 (Video 1, MPEG, 2.5 MB).}
\end{video}

\section{Miscellaneous Formatting Details}
\label{sect:misc}
At times it may be desired, for formatting reasons, to break a line without starting a new paragraph. In a LaTeX source file, a linebreak is created with \verb|\\|.


\subsection{Formatting Equations}
Equations may appear inline with the text, if they are simple, short, and not of major importance; for example, $\beta = b/r$.  Important equations appear on their own line.  Such equations are centered.  For example, ``The expression for the field of view is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fov}
2 a = \frac{(b + 1)}{3c} \, ,
\end{equation}
where $a$ is the ...''  Principal equations are numbered, with the equation number placed within parentheses and right justified.

Equations are considered to be part of a sentence and should be punctuated accordingly. In the above example, a comma appears after the equation because the next line is a subordinate clause. If the equation ends the sentence, a period should follow the equation. The line following an equation should not be indented unless it is meant to start a new paragraph. Indentation after an equation is avoided in LaTeX by not leaving a blank line between the equation and the subsequent text.

References to equations include the equation number in parentheses, for example, ``Equation~(\ref{eq:fov}) shows ...'' or ``Combining Eqs.~(2) and (3), we obtain...'' Note that the word ``Equation'' is spelled out if it begins a sentence, but is abbreviated as ``Eq.'' otherwise. Using a tilde in the LaTeX source file between two characters avoids unwanted line breaks, for example between ``Eq.'' and the following equation number..

\subsection{Formatting Theorems}

To include theorems in a formal way, the theorem identification should appear in a 10-point, bold font, left justified, and followed by a period.  The text of the theorem continues on the same line in normal, 10-pt. font, achieved in LaTeX using \verb|\footnotesize|.  For example,

\vspace{2ex}\noindent{\footnotesize\textbf{Theorem 1.} For any unbiased estimator...}
