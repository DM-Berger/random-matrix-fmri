A poster of extremely limited preliminary results related to this study was presented at the International Symposium for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine 2021 annual conference, and is available in abstract form (see citation at bottom). We attach the poster as well for reference with the submitted files. However, these were extremely preliminary results with almost none of the analyses performed in this paper, and with less than half of the data used in the current manuscript. It was, after all, just a poster.
