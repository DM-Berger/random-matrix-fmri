  abstract = {Random matrix theory (RMT) provides a framework to study the spectral fluctuations in physical systems. RMT is capable of making predictions for the fluctuations only after the removal of the secular properties of the spectrum. Spectral unfolding procedure is used to separate the local level fluctuations from overall energy dependence of the level separation. The unfolding procedure is not unique. Several studies showed that statistics of long-term correlation in the spectrum are very sensitive to the choice of the unfolding function in polynomial unfolding. This can give misleading results regarding the chaoticity of quantum systems. In this letter, we consider the spectra of ordered eigenvalues of large random matrices. We show that the main cause behind the reported sensitivity to the unfolding polynomial degree is the inclusion of specific extreme eigenvalue(s) in the unfolding process.},

  abstract = {Graph-theoretical methods have rapidly become a standard tool in studies of the structure and function of the human brain. Whereas the structural connectome can be fairly straightforwardly mapped onto a complex network, there are more degrees of freedom in constructing networks that represent functional connections between brain areas. For functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, such networks are typically built by aggregating the blood-oxygen-level dependent signal time series of voxels into larger entities (such as Regions of Interest in some brain atlas) and determining their connection strengths from some measure of time-series correlations. Although it is evident that the outcome must be affected by how the voxel-level time series are treated at the preprocessing stage, there is a lack of systematic studies of the effects of preprocessing on network structure. Here, we focus on the effects of spatial smoothing, a standard preprocessing method for fMRI. We apply various levels of spatial smoothing to resting-state fMRI data and measure the changes induced in functional networks. We show that the level of spatial smoothing clearly affects the degrees and other centrality measures of functional network nodes; these changes are non-uniform, systematic, and depend on the geometry of the brain. The composition of the largest connected network component is also affected in a way that artificially increases the similarity of the networks of different subjects. Our conclusion is that wherever possible, spatial smoothing should be avoided when preprocessing fMRI data for network analysis.},

Often, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used to detect and characterize brain changes related to the disorder. Recently, machine learning methods have been employed to reveal new patterns by trying to classify ASD from spatio-temporal fMRI images. Typically, these methods have either focused on temporal or spatial information processing. Instead, we propose a 4D spatio-temporal deep learning approach for ASD classification where we jointly learn from spatial and temporal data. We employ 4D convolutional neural networks and convolutional-recurrent models which outperform a previous approach with an F1-score of 0.71 compared to an F1-score of 0.65.},

  abstract = {Summary. The estimation of a density profile from experimental data points is a challenging problem, which is usually tackled by plotting a histogram. Prior assumptions on the nature of the density, from its smoothness to the specification of its form, allow the design of more accurate estimation procedures, such as maximum likelihood. Our aim is to construct a procedure that makes no explicit assumptions, but still providing an accurate estimate of the density. We introduce the self-consistent estimate: the power spectrum of a candidate density is given, and an estimation procedure is constructed on the assumption, to be released a posteriori, that the candidate is correct. The self-consistent estimate is defined as a prior candidate density that precisely reproduces itself. Our main result is to derive the exact expression of the self-consistent estimate for any given data set, and to study its properties. Applications of the method require neither priors on the form of the density nor the subjective choice of parameters. A cut-off frequency, akin to a bin size or a kernel bandwidth, emerges naturally from the derivation. We apply the self-consistent estimate to artificial data generated from various distributions and show that it reaches the theoretical limit for the scaling of the square error with the size of the data set.},

  abstract = {Network mechanisms of depression development and especially of improvement from nonpharmacological treatment remain understudied. The current study is aimed at examining brain networks functional connectivity in depressed patients and its dynamics in nonpharmacological treatment. Resting state fMRI data of 21 healthy adults and 51 patients with mild or moderate depression were analyzed with spatial independent component analysis; then, correlations between time series of the components were calculated and compared between-group (study 1). Baseline and repeated-measure data of 14 treated (psychotherapy or fMRI neurofeedback) and 15 untreated depressed participants were similarly analyzed and correlated with changes in depression scores (study 2). Aside from diverse findings, studies 1 and 2 both revealed changes in within-default mode network (DMN) and DMN to executive control network (ECN) connections. Connectivity in one pair, initially lower in depression, decreased in no treatment group and was inversely correlated with Montgomery-Asberg depression score change in treatment group. Weak baseline connectivity in this pair also predicted improvement on Montgomery-Asberg scale in both treatment and no treatment groups. Coupling of another pair, initially stronger in depression, increased in therapy though was unrelated to improvement. The results demonstrate possible role of within-DMN and DMN-ECN functional connectivity in depression treatment and suggest that neural mechanisms of nonpharmacological treatment action may be unrelated to normalization of initially disrupted connectivity.},

  abstract = {The utility and success of resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) depend critically on the reliability of this technique and the extent to which it accurately reflects neuronal function. One challenge is that rs-fcMRI is influenced by various sources of noise, particularly cardiac- and respiratory-related signal variations. The goal of the current study was to evaluate the impact of various physiological noise correction techniques, specifically those that use independent cardiac and respiration measures, on the test\textendash retest reliability of rs-fcMRI. A group of 25 subjects were each scanned at three time points\textemdash two within the same imaging session and another 2\textendash 3 months later. Physiological noise corrections accounted for significant variance, particularly in blood vessels, sagittal sinus, cerebrospinal fluid, and gray matter. The fraction of variance explained by each of these corrections was highly similar within subjects between sessions, but variable between subjects. Physiological corrections generally reduced intrasubject (between-session) variability, but also significantly reduced intersubject variability, and thus reduced the test\textendash retest reliability of estimating individual differences in functional connectivity. However, based on known nonneuronal mechanisms by which cardiac pulsation and respiration can lead to MRI signal changes, and the observation that the physiological noise itself is highly stable within individuals, removal of this noise will likely increase the validity of measured connectivity differences. Furthermore, removal of these fluctuations will lead to better estimates of average or group maps of connectivity. It is therefore recommended that studies apply physiological noise corrections but also be mindful of potential correlations with measures of interest.},

These correlated fluctuations occur even when the subject is ``at rest'' (not asked to perform any particular task) and result from spontaneous neuronal activity synchronized within multiple distinct networks of brain regions. This estimate of connectivity, however, can be influenced by physiological noise, such as cardiac and respiratory fluctuations. This brief review looks at the effect of physiological noise on estimates of resting-state functional connectivity, discusses ways to remove physiological noise, and provides a personal recollection of the early developments in these approaches. This review also discusses the importance of physiological noise correction and provides a summary of evidence demonstrating that functional connectivity does have a neuronal underpinning and cannot purely be the result of physiological noise.},

  abstract = {Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) has been applied successfully to task-based and resting-based fMRI recordings to investigate which neural markers distinguish individuals with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) from controls. While most studies have focused on brain connectivity during resting state episodes and regions of interest approaches (ROI), a wealth of task-based fMRI datasets have been acquired in these populations in the last decade. This calls for techniques that can leverage information not only from a single dataset, but from several existing datasets that might share some common features and biomarkers. We propose a fully data-driven (voxel-based) approach that we apply to two different fMRI experiments with social stimuli (faces and bodies). The method, based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), is first trained for each experiment independently and each output is then combined to obtain a final classification output. Second, this RFE output is used to determine which voxels are most often selected for classification to generate maps of significant discriminative activity. Finally, to further explore the clinical validity of the approach, we correlate phenotypic information with obtained classifier scores. The results reveal good classification accuracy (range between 69\% and 92.3\%). Moreover, we were able to identify discriminative activity patterns pertaining to the social brain without relying on a priori ROI definitions. Finally, social motivation was the only dimension which correlated with classifier scores, suggesting that it is the main dimension captured by the classifiers. Altogether, we believe that the present RFE method proves to be efficient and may help identifying relevant biomarkers by taking advantage of acquired task-based fMRI datasets in psychiatric populations.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have reported that the spontaneous, resting-state time course of the default-mode network is negatively correlated with that of the ``task-positive network'', a collection of regions commonly recruited in demanding cognitive tasks. However, all studies of negative correlations between the default-mode and task-positive networks have employed some form of normalization or regression of the whole-brain average signal (``global signal''); these processing steps alter the time series of voxels in an uninterpretable manner as well as introduce spurious negative correlations. Thus, the extent of negative correlations with the default mode network without global signal removal has not been well characterized, and it is has recently been hypothesized that the apparent negative correlations in many of the task-positive regions could be artifactually induced by global signal pre-processing. The present study aimed to examine negative and positive correlations with the default-mode network when model-based corrections for respiratory and cardiac noise are applied in lieu of global signal removal. Physiological noise correction consisted of (1) removal of time-locked cardiac and respiratory artifacts using RETROICOR (Glover, G.H., Li, T.Q., Ress, D., 2000. Image-based method for retrospective correction of physiological motion effects in fMRI: RETROICOR. Magn. Reson. Med. 44, 162\textendash 167), and (2) removal of low-frequency respiratory and heart rate variations by convolving these waveforms with pre-determined transfer functions (Birn et al., 2008; Chang et al., 2009) and projecting the resulting two signals out of the data. It is demonstrated that negative correlations between the default-mode network and regions of the task-positive network are present in the majority of individual subjects both with and without physiological noise correction. Physiological noise correction increased the spatial extent and magnitude of negative correlations, yielding negative correlations within task-positive regions at the group-level (p{$<$}0.05, uncorrected; no regions at the group level were significant at FDR=0.05). Furthermore, physiological noise correction caused region-specific decreases in positive correlations within the default-mode network, reducing apparent false positives. It was observed that the low-frequency respiratory volume and cardiac rate regressors used within the physiological noise correction algorithm displayed significant (but not total) shared variance with the global signal, and constitute a model-based alternative to correcting for non-neural global noise.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In subjects performing no specific cognitive task (``resting state''), time courses of voxels within functionally connected regions of the brain have high cross-correlation coefficients (``functional connectivity''). The purpose of this study was to measure the contributions of low frequencies and physiological noise to cross-correlation maps. METHODS: In four healthy volunteers, task-activation functional MR imaging and resting-state data were acquired. We obtained four contiguous slice locations in the ``resting state'' with a high sampling rate. Regions of interest consisting of four contiguous voxels were selected. The correlation coefficient for the averaged time course and every other voxel in the four slices was calculated and separated into its component frequency contributions. We calculated the relative amounts of the spectrum that were in the low-frequency (0 to 0.1 Hz), the respiratory-frequency (0.1 to 0.5 Hz), and cardiac-frequency range (0.6 to 1.2 Hz). RESULTS: For each volunteer, resting-state maps that resembled task-activation maps were obtained. For the auditory and visual cortices, the correlation coefficient depended almost exclusively on low frequencies ({$<$}0.1 Hz). For all cortical regions studied, low-frequency fluctuations contributed more than 90\% of the correlation coefficient. Physiological (respiratory and cardiac) noise sources contributed less than 10\% to any functional connectivity MR imaging map. In blood vessels and cerebrospinal fluid, physiological noise contributed more to the correlation coefficient. CONCLUSION: Functional connectivity in the auditory, visual, and sensorimotor cortices is characterized predominantly by frequencies slower than those in the cardiac and respiratory cycles. In functionally connected regions, these low frequencies are characterized by a high degree of temporal coherence.},

  abstract = {Accelerated functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) with `multiband' protocols is now relatively widespread. These protocols can be used to dramatically reduce the repetition time (TR) and produce a time-series sampled at a higher temporal resolution, which may produce benefits in the statistical methods typically used to analyse fMRI data. We tested the effects of higher temporal resolutions for fMRI on statistical outcome measures in a comprehensive manner on two different MRI scanner platforms. Spatial resolution was maintained at a constant of 3\,mm isotropic voxels, and an in-plane acceleration factor of 2 was used for all experiments. Experiment 1 tested a range of acceleration factors (1-6) against a standard EPI protocol on a single composite task that mapped a number of basic sensory, motor, and cognitive networks. Experiment 2 compared the standard protocol with acceleration factors of 2 and 3 on both resting-state and two task paradigms (an N-back task, and faces/places task), with a number of different analysis approaches. Results from experiment 1 showed modest but relatively inconsistent effects of the higher sampling rate on statistical outcome measures. Experiment 2 showed strong benefits of the multiband protocols on results derived from resting-state data, but more varied effects on results from the task paradigms. Notably, the multiband protocols were superior when Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis was used to interrogate the faces/places data, but showed less benefit in conventional General Linear Model analyses of the same data. In general, ROI-derived measures of statistical effects benefitted only modestly from higher sampling resolution, with greater effects seen when using a measure of the top range of statistical values. Across both experiments, results from the two scanner platforms were broadly comparable. The statistical benefits of high temporal resolution fMRI with multiband protocols may therefore depend on a number of factors, including the nature of the investigation (resting-state vs. task-based), the experimental design, the particular statistical outcome measure, and the type of analysis used.},

  abstract = {We present a novel method to extract classification features from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected at rest or during the performance of a task. By combining a two-level feature identification scheme with kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (FLD), we achieve high classification rates in discriminating healthy controls from patients with schizophrenia. Experimental results using leave-one-out cross-validation show that features extracted from the default mode network (DMN) lead to a classification accuracy of over 90\% in both data sets. Moreover, using a majority vote method that uses multiple features, we achieve a classification accuracy of 98\% in auditory oddball (AOD) task and 93\% in rest data. Several components, including DMN, temporal and medial visual regions, are consistently present in the set of features that yield high classification accuracy. The features we have extracted thus show promise to be used as biomarkers for schizophrenia. Results also suggest that there may be different advantages to using resting fMRI data or task fMRI data.},

Some RMT results are applied to the problem of clustering high dimensional biological data with complex dependence structure amongst the variables. It will be shown that a gene relevance or correlation network can be constructed by choosing a correlation threshold in a principled way, such that it corresponds to a block diagonal structure in the correlation matrix, if such a structure exists. The structure is then found using community detection algorithms, but with parameter choice guided by RMT predictions. The resulting clustering is compared to a variety of hierarchical clustering outputs and is found to the most generalised result, in that it captures all the features found by the other considered methods.},

For Li+CaH with total angular momentum \$J=0\$ we find fully chaotic behavior in both the nearest-neighbor spacing distribution and the level number variance. However, for \$J{$>$}0\$ we find different behavior due to the presence of a nearly conserved quantum number. Li+CaF (\$J=0\$) also shows apparently reduced levels of chaotic behavior despite its stronger effective coupling. We suggest this may indicate the development of another good quantum number relating to a bending motion of the complex. However, continuously varying the rotational constant over a wide range shows unexpected structure in the degree of chaotic behavior, including a dramatic reduction around the rotational constant of CaF. This demonstrates the complexity of the relationship between coupling and chaotic behavior.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to better understand the physiological meaning of negative correlations in resting state functional connectivity MRI (r-fcMRI). The correlations between anatomy-based brain regions of 18 healthy humans were calculated and analyzed with and without a correction for global signal and with and without spatial smoothing. In addition, correlations between anatomy-based brain regions of 18 na\"ive anesthetized rats were calculated and compared to the human data. T-statistics were used to differentiate between positive and negative connections. The application of spatial smoothing and global signal correction increased the number of significant positive connections but their effect on negative connections was complex. Positive connections were mainly observed between cortical structures while most negative connections were observed between cortical and non-cortical structures with almost no negative connections between non-cortical structures. In both human and rats, negative connections were never observed between bilateral homologous regions. The main difference between positive and negative connections in both the human and rat data was that positive connections became less significant with time-lags, while negative connections became more significant with time-lag. This effect was evident in all four types of analyses (with and without global signal correction and spatial smoothing) but was most significant in the analysis with no correction for the global signal. We hypothesize that the valence of r-fcMRI connectivity reflects the relative contributions of cerebral blood volume (CBV) and flow (CBF) to the BOLD signal and that these relative contributions are location-specific. If cerebral circulation is primarily regulated by CBF in one region and by CBV in another, a functional connection between these regions can manifest as an r-fcMRI negative and time-delayed correlation. Similarly, negative correlations could result from spatially inhomogeneous responses of rCBV or rCBF alone. Consequently, neuronal regulation of brain circulation may be deduced from the valence of r-fcMRI connectivity.},

  abstract = {Individuals who speak more than one language have been found to enjoy a number of benefits not directly associated with the use of the languages themselves. One of these benefits is that bilingual individuals appear to develop symptoms of dementia 4-5 years later than comparable individuals who speak just one language. Studies on this topic, however, do not consistently account for factors including if the individual learned their second language as a child or later in life, or their language proficiency. In an attempt to more carefully examine these variables, this study looks at structural and resting-state functional MRI scans of the default mode network, English and Spanish (where applicable) proficiency, language background, and demographics of young healthy adults who fall into one of three groups: early bilinguals, late bilinguals, and monolinguals. Of the three groups, late bilinguals were found to have a small but statistically significantly higher level of connectivity compared with early bilinguals in the region of the medial prefrontal cortex; patterns found examining number of languages and language proficiency in relation to functional connectivity and research group also supported this finding. These results indicate studying a language after adolescence could provide neuroprotective benefits of a nature that could potentially help delay symptoms of dementia. Age, gender, ethnicity, level of education, English language proficiency, and Spanish language use did not result in statistically significant findings, the latter of which challenges using frequency of language use to define bilingualism.},

The review is preceded by a brief historical survey of the developments of RMT and of localization theory since their inception. We emphasize the concepts common to the above-mentioned fields as well as the great diversity of RMT. In view of the universality of RMT, we suggest that the current development signals the emergence of a new ``statistical mechanics'': Stochasticity and general symmetry requirements lead to universal laws not based on dynamical principles.},

  abstract = {To be able to examine dynamic and detailed brain functions, the spatial and temporal resolution of 7 T MRI needs to improve. In this study, it was investigated whether submillimeter multishot 3D EPI fMRI scans, acquired with high-density receive arrays, can benefit from a 2D CAIPIRINHA sampling pattern, in terms of noise amplification (g-factor), temporal SNR and fMRI sensitivity. High-density receive arrays were combined with a shot-selective 2D CAIPIRINHA implementation for multishot 3D EPI sequences at 7 T. In this implementation, in contrast to conventional inclusion of extra kz gradient blips, specific EPI shots are left out to create a CAIPIRINHA shift and reduction of scan time. First, the implementation of the CAIPIRINHA sequence was evaluated with a standard receive setup by acquiring submillimeter whole brain T2*-weighted anatomy images. Second, the CAIPIRINHA sequence was combined with high-density receive arrays to push the temporal resolution of submillimeter 3D EPI fMRI scans of the visual cortex. Results show that the shot-selective 2D CAIPIRINHA sequence enables a reduction in scan time for 0.5 mm isotropic 3D EPI T2*-weighted anatomy scans by a factor of 4 compared with earlier reports. The use of the 2D CAIPIRINHA implementation in combination with high-density receive arrays, enhances the image quality of submillimeter 3D EPI scans of the visual cortex at high acceleration as compared to conventional SENSE. Both the g-factor and temporal SNR improved, resulting in a method that is more sensitive to the fMRI signal. Using this method, it is possible to acquire submillimeter single volume 3D EPI scans of the visual cortex in a subsecond timeframe. Overall, high-density receive arrays in combination with shot-selective 2D CAIPIRINHA for 3D EPI scans prove to be valuable for reducing the scan time of submillimeter MRI acquisitions.},

  abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research has revealed not only important aspects of the neural basis of cognitive and perceptual functions, but also important information on the relation between high-level brain functions and physiology. One of the central outstanding questions, given the features of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal, is whether and how autonomic nervous system (ANS) functions are related to changes in brain states as measured in the human brain. A straightforward way to address this question has been to acquire external measurements of ANS activity such as cardiac and respiratory data, and examine their relation to the BOLD signal. In this article, we describe two conceptual approaches to the treatment of ANS measures in the context of BOLD fMRI analysis. On the one hand, several research lines have treated ANS activity measures as noise, considering them as nothing but a confounding factor that reduces the power of fMRI analysis or its validity. Work in this line has developed powerful methods to remove ANS effects from the BOLD signal. On the other hand, a different line of work has made important progress in showing that ANS functions such as cardiac pulsation, heart rate variability and breathing rate could be considered as a theoretically meaningful component of the signal that is useful for understanding brain function. Work within this latter framework suggests that caution should be exercised when employing procedures to remove correlations between BOLD data and physiological measures. We discuss these two positions and the reasoning underlying them. Thereafter, we draw on the reviewed literature in presenting practical guidelines for treatment of ANS data, which are based on the premise that ANS data should be considered as theoretically meaningful information. This holds particularly when studying cortical systems involved in regulation, monitoring and/or generation of ANS activity, such as those involved in decision making, conflict resolution and the experience of emotion.},

In other words they need to be compared with some sort of criterion to provide a basis for the most suitable and applicable conclusions. In the context of the present study, the criterion is selected to be the well-known fractional Gaussian noise (fGn). We illustrate the applicability of our method in the context of stock markets. For the former, despite the non-Gaussianity in returns of the stock markets, a remarkable agreement with the fGn is achieved.},

Many different automatic registration methods have been proposed to date, and almost all share a common mathematical framework - one of optimising a cost function. To date little attention has been focused on the optimisation method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimisation. This paper examines the assumptions underlying the problem of registration for brain images using inter-modal voxel similarity measures. It is demonstrated that the use of local optimisation methods together with the standard multi-resolution approach is not sufficient to reliably find the global minimum. To address this problem, a global optimisation method is proposed that is specifically tailored to this form of registration. A full discussion of all the necessary implementation details is included as this is an important part of any practical method. Furthermore, results are presented for inter-modal, inter-subject registration experiments that show that the proposed method is more reliable at finding the global minimum than several of the currently available registration packages in common usage.},

Most modern methods optimize some intensity-based cost function to determine the best registration. To date, little attention has been focused on the optimization method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimization. This paper examines the optimization process in detail and demonstrates that the commonly used multiresolution local optimization methods can, and do, get trapped in local minima. To address this problem, two approaches are taken: (1) to apodize the cost function and (2) to employ a novel hybrid global-local optimization method. This new optimization method is specifically designed for registering whole brain images. It substantially reduces the likelihood of producing misregistrations due to being trapped by local minima. The increased robustness of the method, compared to other commonly used methods, is demonstrated by a consistency test. In addition, the accuracy of the registration is demonstrated by a series of experiments with motion correction. These motion correction experiments also investigate how the results are affected by different cost functions and interpolation methods.},

In the present study, we investigate the contribution of physiological noise and its impact on assessment of functional connectivity in rs-fMRI of medetomidine sedated, spontaneously breathing rats at ultrahigh field of 11.7Tesla. We employed gradient echo planar imaging (EPI) with repetition times of 3s and used simultaneous recordings of physiological parameters. A model of linear regression was applied to quantify the amount of BOLD fMRI signal fluctuations attributable to physiological sources. Our results indicate that physiological noise \textendash{} mainly originating from the respiratory cycle -dominates the rs-fMRI time course in the form of spatially complex correlation patterns. As a consequence, these physiological fluctuations introduce severe artifacts into seed-based correlation maps and lead to misinterpretation of corresponding connectivity measures. We demonstrate that a scheme of motion correction and linear regression can significantly reduce physiological noise in the rs-fMRI time course, remove artifacts, and hence improve the reproducibility of functional connectivity assessment. In conclusion, physiological noise can severely compromise functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) of the rodent at high fields and must be carefully considered in design and interpretation of future studies. Motion correction should be considered the primary strategy for reduction of apparent motion related to respiratory fluctuations. Combined with subsequent regression of physiological confounders, this strategy has proven successful in reducing physiological noise and related artifacts affecting functional connectivity analysis. The proposed new and rigorous protocol now opens the potential of fcMRI to elicit the role of brain connectivity in pathological processes without concerns of confounding contributions from physiological noise.},

  abstract = {Growing interest in pharmacological resting state fMRI (RSfMRI) necessitates developing standardized and robust analytical approaches that are insensitive to spurious correlated physiological signals. However, in pharmacological experiments physiological variations constitute an important aspect of the pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic profile of drug action; therefore retrospective corrective methods that discard physiological signals as noise may not be suitable. Previously, we have shown that template-based dual regression analysis is a sensitive method for model-free and objective detection of drug-specific effects on functional brain connectivity. In the current study, the robustness of this standard approach to physiological variations in a placebo controlled, repeated measures pharmacological RSfMRI study of morphine and alcohol in 12 healthy young men is tested. The impact of physiology-related variations on statistical inferences has been studied by: 1) modeling average physiological rates in higher level group analysis; 2) Regressing out the instantaneous respiration variation (RV); 3) applying retrospective image correction (RETROICOR) in the preprocessing stage; and 4) performing combined RV and heart rate correction (RVHRCOR) by regressing out physiological pulses convolved with canonical respiratory and cardiac hemodynamic response functions. Results indicate regional sensitivity of the BOLD signal to physiological variations, especially in the vicinity of large vessels, plus certain brain structures that are reported to be involved in physiological regulation, such as posterior cingulate, precuneus, medial prefrontal and insular cortices, as well as the thalamus, cerebellum and the brainstem. The largest impact of ``correction'' on final statistical test outcomes resulted from including the average respiration frequency and heart rate in the higher-level group analysis. Overall, the template-based dual regression method seems robust against physical noise that is corrected by RV regression or RETROICOR. However, convolving the RV and HR with canonical hemodynamic response functions caused a notable change in the BOLD signal variance, and in resting state connectivity estimates. The impact of RVHRCOR on statistical tests was limited to elimination of both morphine and alcohol effects related to the somatosensory network that consists of insula and cingulate cortex\textemdash important structures for autonomic regulation. Although our data do not warrant speculations about neuronal or vascular origins of these effects, these observations raise caution about the implications of physiological `noise' and the risks of introducing false positives (e.g. increased white matter connectivity) by using generalized physiological correction methods in pharmacological studies. The obvious sensitivity of the posterior part of the default mode network to different correction schemes, underlines the importance of controlling for physiological fluctuations in seed-based functional connectivity analyses.},

SE-EPI, in contrast, is minimally affected by these artifacts. In this study, we quantify, for the first time, the sensitivity and specificity of SE and GE EPI for resting-state fMRI functional connectivity (fcMRI) mapping, using the 1000-brain fcMRI atlas (Yeo et al., 2011) as the pseudoground truth. Moreover, we assess the influence of physiological processes on resting-state BOLD measured using both regular and ultrafast GE and SE acquisitions. Our work demonstrates that SE-EPI and GE-EPI are associated with similar sensitivities, specificities, and intersubject reproducibility in fcMRI for most brain networks, generated using both seed-based analysis and independent component analysis. More importantly, SE-based fcMRI measurements demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity, specificity, and intersubject reproducibility in high-susceptibility regions, spanning the limbic and frontal networks in the 1000-brain atlas. In addition, SE-EPI is significantly less sensitive to prominent sources of physiological noise, including low-frequency respiratory volume and heart rate variations. Our work suggests that SE-EPI should be increasingly adopted in the study of networks spanning susceptibility-affected brain regions, including those that are important to memory, language, and emotion.},

  abstract = {In recent years the field of fMRI research has enjoyed expanded technical abilities related to resolution, as well as use across many fields of brain research. At the same time, the field has also dealt with uncertainty related to many known and unknown effects of artifact in fMRI data. In this review we discuss an emerging fMRI technology, called multi-echo (ME)-fMRI, which focuses on improving the fidelity and interpretability of fMRI. Where the essential problem of standard single-echo fMRI is the indeterminacy of sources of signals, whether BOLD or artifact, this is not the case for ME-fMRI. By acquiring multiple echo images per slice, the ME approach allows T2* decay to be modeled at every voxel at every time point. Since BOLD signals arise by changes in T2* over time, an fMRI experiment sampling the T2* signal decay can be analyzed to distinguish BOLD from artifact signal constituents. While the ME approach has a long history of use in theoretical and validation studies, modern MRI systems enable whole-brain multi-echo fMRI at high resolution. This review covers recent multi-echo fMRI acquisition methods, and the analysis steps for this data to make fMRI at once more principled, straightforward, and powerful. After a brief overview of history and theory, T2* modeling and applications will be discussed. These applications include T2* mapping and combining echoes from ME data to increase BOLD contrast and mitigate dropout artifacts. Next, the modeling of fMRI signal changes to detect signal origins in BOLD-related T2* versus artifact-related S0 changes will be reviewed. A focus is on the use of ME-fMRI data to extract and classify components from spatial ICA, called multi-echo ICA (ME-ICA). After describing how ME-fMRI and ME-ICA lead to a general model for analysis of fMRI signals, applications in animal and human imaging will be discussed. Applications include removing motion artifacts in resting state data at subject and group level. New imaging methods such as multi-band multi-echo fMRI and imaging at 7T are demonstrated throughout the review, and a practical analysis pipeline is described. The review culminates with evidence from recent studies of major boosts in statistical power from using multi-echo fMRI for detecting activation and connectivity in healthy individuals and patients with neuropsychiatric disease. In conclusion, the review shows evidence that the multi-echo approach expands the range of experiments that is practicable using fMRI. These findings suggest a compelling future role of the multi-echo approach in subject-level and clinical fMRI.},

  abstract = {The evolution with {$\beta$} of the distributions of the spacing `s' between nearest-neighbour levels of unfolded spectra of random matrices from the {$\beta$}-Hermite ensemble ({$\beta$}-HE) is investigated by Monte Carlo simulations. The random matrices from the {$\beta$}-HE are real symmetric and tridiagonal where {$\beta$}, which can take any positive value, is the reciprocal of the temperature in the classical electrostatic interpretation of eigenvalues. The distribution of eigenvalues coincide with those of the three classical Gaussian ensembles for {$\beta$}=1, 2, 4. The use of the {$\beta$}-HE ensemble results in an incomparable speed up and efficiency of numerical simulations of all spectral characteristics of large random matrices. Generalized gamma distributions are shown to be excellent approximations of the nearest-neighbor spacing (NNS) distributions for any {$\beta$} while being still simple. They account both for the level repulsion in {$\sim$}s{$\beta$} when s\textrightarrow 0 and for the whole shape of the NNS distributions in the range of `s' which is accessible to experiment or to most numerical simulations. The exact NNS distribution of the GOE ({$\beta$}=1) is in particular significantly better described by a generalized gamma distribution than it is by the Wigner surmise while the best generalized gamma approximation coincides essentially with the Wigner surmise for {$\beta>\sim$}2. They describe too the evolution of the level repulsion between that of a Poisson distribution and that of a GOE distribution when {$\beta$} increases from 0 to 1. The distribution of ln(s), related to the electrostatic interaction energy between neighbouring charges, is accordingly well approximated by a generalized Gumbel distribution for any {$\beta\geqslant$}0. The distributions of the minimum NN spacing between eigenvalues of matrices from the {$\beta$}-HE, obtained both from as-calculated eigenvalues and from unfolded eigenvalues are Brody distributions which are classically used to characterize the spectral fluctuations of various physical systems.},

  abstract = {Background Pearson correlation (simply correlation) is a basic technique for neuroimage function analysis. It has been observed that the spatial smoothing may cause functional overestimation, which however remains a lack of complete understanding. Herein, we present a theoretical explanation from the perspective of correlation scale invariance. New methods For a task-evoked spatiotemporal functional dataset, we can extract the functional spatial map by calculating the temporal correlations (tcorr) of voxel timecourses against the task timecourse. From the relationship between image noise level (changed through spatial smoothing) and the tcorr map calculation, we show that the spatial smoothing causes a noise reduction, which in turn smooths the tcorr map and leads to a spatial expansion on neuroactivity blob estimation. Results Through numerical simulations and subject experiments, we show that the spatial smoothing of fMRI data may overestimate activation spots in the correlation functional map. Our results suggest a small spatial smoothing (with a smoothing kernel with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of no more than two voxels) on fMRI data processing for correlation-based functional mapping Comparison with existing methods In extreme noiselessness, the correlation of scale-invariance property defines a meaningless binary tcorr map. In reality, a functional activity blob in a tcorr map is shaped due to the spoilage of image noise on correlative responses. We may reduce data noise level by smoothing processing, which poses a smoothing effect on correlation. This logic allows us to understand the noise dependence and the smoothing effect of correlation-based fMRI data analysis.},

Such random matrices follow the so-called Wishart-type distribution, a generic designation for both Wishart and pseudo-Wishart distributions. More specifically, we propose new simple expressions for the probability density function (PDF) and derive the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of any subset of unordered eigenvalues of Wishart-type random matrices with arbitrary finite dimensions. Many interesting results can be deduced from the foregoing distributions. In particular, one can straightforwardly deduce the statistics of the largest eigenvalue of Wishart-type random matrices, thereby paving the way for the second contribution of this paper, namely, analyzing the average error probability of dual multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems using maximum-ratio transmission (MRT), subject to frequency-nonselective semicorrelated Rayleigh fading. Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulations are carried out and shown to be in perfect match with the corresponding analytical results, thereby illustrating their validity.},

However, the extent and nature of changes in the brain is poorly understood.                                         Methods.               We investigated brain network architecture using resting-state fMRI data in chronic back pain patients in the UK and Japan (41 patients, 56 controls), as well as open data from USA. We applied machine learning and deep learning (conditional variational autoencoder architecture) methods to explore classification of patients/controls based on network connectivity. We then studied the network topology of the data, and developed a multislice modularity method to look for consensus evidence of modular reorganisation in chronic back pain.                                         Results.               Machine learning and deep learning allowed reliable classification of patients in a third, independent open data set with an accuracy of 63\%, with 68\% in cross validation of all data. We identified robust evidence of network hub disruption in chronic pain, most consistently with respect to clustering coefficient~and betweenness centrality. We found a consensus pattern of modular reorganisation involving extensive, bilateral regions of sensorimotor cortex, and characterised primarily by negative reorganisation - a tendency for sensorimotor cortex nodes to be less inclined to form pairwise modular links with other brain nodes. Furthermore, these regions were found to display increased connectivity with the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex, a region known to be involved in endogenous pain control. In contrast, intraparietal sulcus displayed a propensity towards positive modular reorganisation, suggesting that it might have a role in forming modules associated with the chronic pain state.                                         Conclusion.               The results provide evidence of consistent and characteristic brain network changes in chronic pain, characterised primarily by extensive reorganisation of the network architecture of the sensorimotor cortex.},

  abstract = {Random Matrix Theory (RMT) is applied to analyze the weight matrices of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), including both production quality, pre-trained models such as AlexNet and Inception, and smaller models trained from scratch, such as LeNet5 and a miniature-AlexNet. Empirical and theoretical results clearly indicate that the DNN training process itself implicitly implements a form of Self-Regularization, implicitly sculpting a more regularized energy or penalty landscape. In particular, the empirical spectral density (ESD) of DNN layer matrices displays signatures of traditionally-regularized statistical models, even in the absence of exogenously specifying traditional forms of explicit regularization, such as Dropout or Weight Norm constraints. Building on relatively recent results in RMT, most notably its extension to Universality classes of Heavy-Tailed matrices, and applying them to these empirical results, we develop a theory to identify 5+1 Phases of Training, corresponding to increasing amounts of Implicit Self-Regularization. These phases can be observed during the training process as well as in the final learned DNNs. For smaller and/or older DNNs, this Implicit Self-Regularization is like traditional Tikhonov regularization, in that there is a ``size scale'' separating signal from noise. For state-of-the-art DNNs, however, we identify a novel form of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization, similar to the self-organization seen in the statistical physics of disordered systems (such as classical models of actual neural activity). This results from correlations arising at all size scales, which for DNNs arises implicitly due to the training process itself. This implicit Self-Regularization can depend strongly on the many knobs of the training process. In particular, we demonstrate that we can cause a small model to exhibit all 5+1 phases of training simply by changing the batch size. Our results suggest that large, well-trained DNN architectures should exhibit Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization, and we discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this.},

Randomness is defined here as the intrinsic correlations that exist between different brain regions when the brain is in a task-free state. We use fMRI data of three brain states in a set of back pain patients monitored over a period of 6 months. We find that randomness in the task-free state closely follows the predictions of Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices. However, the randomness decreases when the brain is engaged in attending to painful inputs in patients suffering with early stages of back pain. A persistence of this pattern is observed in the patients that develop chronic back pain, while the patients who recover from pain after six months, the randomness no longer varies with the pain task. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of random matrix theory in differentiating between resting state and two distinct task states within the same patient. Further, it demonstrates that random matrix theory is effective in measuring systematic changes occurring in functional connectivity and offers new insights on how acute and chronic pain are processed in the brain at a network level.},

For clusters, the number of particles is varied to investigate the effect of finite size on various properties. To study bulk amorphous systems, we actually use periodic crystals with as large a primitive cell as possible. For any finite disorder, the number of particles in the primitive cell should ideally be made arbitrarily large. However, in practice, this is limited by the available computational resources. We should note here that due to the periodic nature of our approximation to the bulk disordered system, the analysis of spectral fluctuations becomes a lot more subtle and has not been reported in this thesis.

  abstract = {The analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data involves multiple stages of data pre-processing before the activation can be statistically detected. Spatial smoothing is a very common pre-processing step in the analysis of functional brain imaging data. This study presents a broad perspective on the influence of spatial smoothing on fMRI group activation results. The data obtained from 20 volunteers during a visual oddball task were used for this study. Spatial smoothing using an isotropic gaussian filter kernel with full width at half maximum (FWHM) sizes 2 to 30 mm with a step of 2 mm was applied in two levels - smoothing of fMRI data and/or smoothing of single-subject contrast files prior to general linear model random-effects group analysis generating statistical parametric maps. Five regions of interest were defined, and several parameters (coordinates of nearest local maxima, t value, corrected threshold, effect size, residual values, etc.) were evaluated to examine the effects of spatial smoothing. The optimal filter size for group analysis is discussed according to various criteria. For our experiment, the optimal FWHM is about 8 mm. We can conclude that for robust experiments and an adequate number of subjects in the study, the optimal FWHM for single-subject inference is similar to that for group inference (about 8 mm, according to spatial resolution). For less robust experiments and fewer subjects in the study, a higher FWHM would be optimal for group inference than for single-subject inferences.},

  abstract = {Functional MRI blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes can be subtle, motivating the use of imaging parameters and processing strategies that maximize the temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) and thus the detection power of neuronal activity-induced fluctuations. Previous studies have shown that acquiring data at higher spatial resolutions results in greater percent BOLD signal changes, and furthermore that spatially smoothing higher resolution fMRI data improves tSNR beyond that of data originally acquired at a lower resolution. However, higher resolution images come at the cost of increased acquisition time, and the number of image volumes also influences detectability. The goal of our study is to determine how the detection power of neuronally induced BOLD fluctuations acquired at higher spatial resolutions and then spatially smoothed compares to data acquired at the lower resolutions with the same imaging duration. The number of time points acquired during a given amount of imaging time is a practical consideration given the limited ability of certain populations to lie still in the MRI scanner. We compare acquisitions at three different in-plane spatial resolutions (3.50\texttimes 3.50mm2, 2.33\texttimes 2.33mm2, 1.75\texttimes 1.75mm2) in terms of their tSNR, contrast-to-noise ratio, and the power to detect both task-related activation and resting-state functional connectivity. The impact of SENSE acceleration, which speeds up acquisition time increasing the number of images collected, is also evaluated. Our results show that after spatially smoothing the data to the same intrinsic resolution, lower resolution acquisitions have a slightly higher detection power of task-activation in some, but not all, brain areas. There were no significant differences in functional connectivity as a function of resolution after smoothing. Similarly, the reduced tSNR of fMRI data acquired with a SENSE factor of 2 is offset by the greater number of images acquired, resulting in few significant differences in detection power of either functional activation or connectivity after spatial smoothing.},

In the class of spiked models, we apply random matrix theory to derive asymptotic first-order and distributional results for both the leading eigenvalues and eigenvectors of sample correlation matrices, assuming a high dimensional regime in which the ratio p/n, of number of variables p to sample size n, converges to a positive constant. While the first order spectral properties of sample correlation matrices match those of sample covariance matrices, their asymptotic distributions can differ significantly. Indeed, the correlation-based fluctuations of both sample eigenvalues and eigenvectors are often remarkably smaller than those of their sample covariance counterparts.},

Slice timing correction (STC) is a critical preprocessing step that corrects for this temporal misalignment. Interpolation-based STC is implemented in all major fMRI processing software packages. To date, little effort has gone towards assessing the optimal method of STC. Delineating the benefits of STC can be challenging because of its slice-dependent gain as well as its interaction with other fMRI artifacts. In this study, we propose a new optimal method (Filter-Shift) based on the fundamental properties of sampling theory in digital signal processing. We then evaluate our method by comparing it to two other methods of STC from the most popular statistical software packages, SPM and FSL. STC methods were evaluated using 338 simulated and 30 real fMRI data and demonstrate the effectiveness of STC in general as well as the superiority of the proposed method in comparison to existing ones. All methods were evaluated under various scan conditions such as motion level, interleave sequence, scanner sampling rate, and the duration of the scan itself.,},

  abstract = {Interhemispheric communication may be constrained as brain size increases because of transmission delays in action potentials over the length of axons. Although one might expect larger brains to have progressively thicker axons to compensate, spatial packing is a limiting factor. Axon size distributions within the primate corpus callosum (CC) may provide insights into how these demands affect conduction velocity. We used electron microscopy to explore phylogenetic variation in myelinated axon density and diameter of the CC from 14 different anthropoid primate species, including humans. The majority of axons were less than 1 \textmu m in diameter across all species, indicating that conduction velocity for most interhemispheric communication is relatively constant regardless of brain size. The largest axons within the upper 95th percentile scaled with a progressively higher exponent than the median axons towards the posterior region of the CC. While brain mass among the primates in our analysis varied by 97-fold, estimates of the fastest cross-brain conduction times, as conveyed by axons at the 95th percentile, varied within a relatively narrow range between 3 and 9 ms across species, whereas cross-brain conduction times for the median axon diameters differed more substantially between 11 and 38 ms. Nonetheless, for both size classes of axons, an increase in diameter does not entirely compensate for the delay in interhemispheric transmission time that accompanies larger brain size. Such biophysical constraints on the processing speed of axons conveyed by the CC may play an important role in the evolution of hemispheric asymmetry.},

Ventricle signals are related to low-frequency modulations of cardiac and respiratory rhythms, which are nonstationary activities. Herein, we employed an adaptive filtering approach to improve removing physiological noise from BOLD signals. Comparisons between filtering approaches were performed by evaluating the amount of removed signal variance and the connectivity between homologous contralateral regions of interest (ROIs). The global connectivity between ROIs was estimated with a generalized correlation named RV coefficient. The mean ROI decrease of variance was -52\% and -11\%, for adaptive filtering and GLM, respectively. Adaptive filtering led to higher connectivity between grey matter ROIs than that obtained with GLM. Thus, adaptive filtering is a feasible method for removing the physiological noise in the low frequency band and to highlight resting state functional networks.},

As symptom severity may influence brain activity, we investigated whether the severity of MDD affected the accuracies of machine learned MDD-vs-Control diagnostic classifiers. Methods Forty-five medication-free patients with DSM-IV defined MDD and 19 healthy controls participated in the study. Based on depression severity as determined by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), MDD patients were sorted into three groups: mild to moderate depression (HRSD 14\textendash 19), severe depression (HRSD 20\textendash 23), and very severe depression (HRSD {$\geq$}24). We collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data during both resting-state and an emotional-face matching task. Patients in each of the three severity groups were compared against controls in separate analyses, using either the resting-state or task-based fMRI data. We use each of these six datasets with linear support vector machine (SVM) binary classifiers for identifying individuals as patients or controls. Results The resting-state fMRI data showed statistically significant classification accuracy only for the very severe depression group (accuracy 66\%, p=0.012 corrected), while mild to moderate (accuracy 58\%, p=1.0 corrected) and severe depression (accuracy 52\%, p=1.0 corrected) were only at chance. With task-based fMRI data, the automated classifier performed at chance in all three severity groups. Conclusions Binary linear SVM classifiers achieved significant classification of very severe depression with resting-state fMRI, but the contribution of brain measurements may have limited potential in differentiating patients with less severe depression from healthy controls.},

Recent advancements in machine learning techniques have shown promising outcomes for individualized prediction and characterization of patients with psychiatric disorders. Studies have utilized features from a variety of neuroimaging modalities, including structural, functional, and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data, as well as jointly estimated features from multiple modalities, to assess patients with heterogeneous mental disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism. We use the term ``predictome'' to describe the use of multivariate brain network features from one or more neuroimaging modalities to predict mental illness. In the predictome, multiple brain network-based features (either from the same modality or multiple modalities) are incorporated into a predictive model to jointly estimate features that are unique to a disorder and predict subjects accordingly. To date, more than 650 studies have been published on subject-level prediction focusing on psychiatric disorders. We have surveyed about 250 studies including schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive\textendash compulsive disorder, social anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance dependence. In this review, we present a comprehensive review of recent neuroimaging-based predictomic approaches, current trends, and common shortcomings and share our vision for future directions.},

  abstract = {Background Resting state fMRI has emerged as a popular neuroimaging method for automated recognition and classification of brain disorders. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common brain disorders affecting young children, yet its underlying mechanism is not completely understood and its diagnosis is mainly dependent on behaviour analysis. New method In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning architecture to diagnose ADHD. Our aim is to (1) automatically classify a subject as ADHD or healthy control, and (2) demonstrate the importance of functional connectivity to increase classification accuracy and provide interpretable results. The proposed method, called DeepFMRI, is comprised of three sequential networks, namely (1) a feature extractor, (2) a functional connectivity network, and (3) a classification network. The model takes fMRI pre-processed time-series signals as input and outputs a diagnosis, and is trained end-to-end using back-propagation. Results Experimental results on the publicly available ADHD-200 dataset demonstrate that this innovative method outperforms previous state-of-the-art. Different imaging sites contributed the data to the ADHD-200 dataset. For the New York University imaging site, our proposed method was able to achieve classification accuracy of 73.1\% (specificity 91.6\%, sensitivity 65.5\%). Comparison with existing methods In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning method incorporating functional connectivity for the classification of ADHD. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been explored by existing studies. Conclusions The results suggest that the proposed end-to-end deep learning architecture achieves better performance as compared to the other state-of-the-art methods. The findings suggest that the frontal lobe contains the most discriminative power towards the classification of ADHD.},

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) pattern analysis to track item-level replay in the hippocampus during an awake rest period after participants studied 15 objects and completed a memory test. Objects that were remembered less well were replayed more during the subsequent rest period, suggesting a prioritization process in which weaker memories\textemdash memories most vulnerable to forgetting\textemdash are selected for replay. In a second session 12\,hours later, more replay of an object during a rest period predicted better subsequent memory for that object. Replay predicted memory improvement across sessions only for participants who slept during that interval. Our results provide evidence that replay in the human hippocampus prioritizes weakly learned information, predicts subsequent memory performance, and relates to memory improvement across a delay with sleep., The hippocampus is known to 'replay' experiences and memories during rest periods, but it is unclear how particular memories are prioritized for replay. Here, the authors show that information that is remembered less well is replayed more often, suggesting that weaker memories are selected for replay.},

It has been proposed that these three self-referential processes involve a highly interconnected core set of brain structures known as the default mode network (DMN). The DMN appears to be active when individuals are engaged in stimulus-independent thought. This network is a likely candidate for supporting multiple processes, but this idea has not been tested directly. We used fMRI to examine brain activity during autobiographical remembering, prospection, and theory-of-mind reasoning. Using multivariate analyses, we found a common pattern of neural activation underlying all three processes in the DMN. In addition, autobiographical remembering and prospection engaged midline DMN structures to a greater degree and theory-of-mind reasoning engaged lateral DMN areas. A functional connectivity analysis revealed that activity of a critical node in the DMN, medial prefrontal cortex, was correlated with activity in other regions in the DMN during all three tasks. We conclude that the DMN supports common aspects of these cognitive behaviors involved in simulating an internalized experience.},

Using estimates of LFF physiological noise derived from measured cardiac and respiration signals, noise can be filtered from the time series thus improving the results of functional connectivity analysis. The ability of spatial independent component analysis (ICA) to separate LFF physiological noise from the default mode network (DMN), which overlap each other spatially and occur at similar frequencies, has remained an open question. We aimed to define the net effect of physiological correction for spatial ICA DMN detection at 1.5T by statistically testing obtained ICASSO centrotype DMN maps before and after physiological correction. Comparisons with 21 subjects were performed for ICA model orders 20, 30 and 40 and no statistically significant spatial difference was found after physiological correction, although slight DMN reduction in precuneus or sagittal sinus was detected in all dimensionalities. A confounding factor in the analysis is the susceptibility of the ICA decomposition for data changes yielding different DMN splitting between and after physiological correction conditions without comparable true change in the data. This issue is mitigated at higher ICA model orders. The results suggest that subject-level DMN can for some subjects be optimized by physiological correction, but on the group-level this contribution is minor.},

Recently, brain activity in the resting state is gathering attention for exploring altered functional connectivity in psychiatric disorders. Although previous resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging studies investigated the neurobiological abnormalities of patients with OCD, there are concerns that should be addressed. One concern is the validity of the hypothesis employed. Most studies used seed-based analysis of the fronto-striatal circuit, despite the potential for abnormalities in other regions. A hypothesis-free study is a promising approach in such a case, while it requires researchers to handle a dataset with large dimensions. Another concern is the reliability of biomarkers derived from a single dataset, which may be influenced by cohort-specific features. Here, our machine learning algorithm identified an OCD biomarker that achieves high accuracy for an internal dataset (AUC\,=\,0.81; N\,=\,108) and demonstrates generalizability to an external dataset (AUC\,=\,0.70; N\,=\,28). Our biomarker was unaffected by medication status, and the functional networks contributing to the biomarker were distributed widely, including the frontoparietal and default mode networks. Our biomarker has the potential to deepen our understanding of OCD and to be applied clinically.},

Here we identified and validated that clinical placebo response is predictable from resting-state functional magnetic-resonance-imaging (fMRI) brain connectivity. This also led to discovering a brain region predicting active drug response and demonstrating the adverse effect of active drug interfering with placebo analgesia. Chronic knee osteoarthritis (OA) pain patients (n = 56) underwent pretreatment brain scans in two clinical trials. Study 1 (n = 17) was a 2-wk single-blinded placebo pill trial. Study 2 (n = 39) was a 3-mo double-blinded randomized trial comparing placebo pill to duloxetine. Study 3, which was conducted in additional knee OA pain patients (n = 42), was observational. fMRI-derived brain connectivity maps in study 1 were contrasted between placebo responders and nonresponders and compared to healthy controls (n = 20). Study 2 validated the primary biomarker and identified a brain region predicting drug response. In both studies, approximately half of the participants exhibited analgesia with placebo treatment. In study 1, right midfrontal gyrus connectivity best identified placebo responders. In study 2, the same measure identified placebo responders (95\% correct) and predicted the magnitude of placebo's effectiveness. By subtracting away linearly modeled placebo analgesia from duloxetine response, we uncovered in 6/19 participants a tendency of duloxetine enhancing predicted placebo response, while in another 6/19, we uncovered a tendency for duloxetine to diminish it. Moreover, the approach led to discovering that right parahippocampus gyrus connectivity predicts drug analgesia after correcting for modeled placebo-related analgesia. Our evidence is consistent with clinical placebo response having biological underpinnings and shows that the method can also reveal that active treatment in some patients diminishes modeled placebo-related analgesia.

Before creating a functional brain network, the fMRI time series must undergo several preprocessing steps to control for artifacts and to improve data quality. However, preprocessing may affect the results in an undesirable way. Spatial smoothing, for example, is known to alter functional network structure. Yet, its effects on group-level network differences remain unknown. Here, we investigate the effects of spatial smoothing on the difference between patients and controls for two clinical conditions: autism spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder, considering fMRI data smoothed with Gaussian kernels (0-32 mm). We find that smoothing affects network differences between groups. For weighted networks, incrementing the smoothing kernel makes networks more different. For thresholded networks, larger smoothing kernels lead to more similar networks, although this depends on the network density. Smoothing also alters the effect sizes of the individual link differences. This is independent of the ROI size, but vary with link length. The effects of spatial smoothing are diverse, non-trivial, and difficult to predict. This has important consequences: the choice of smoothing kernel affects the observed network differences.},

  abstract = {Physiological noise dominates the SNR of the fMRI time-course at commonly used spatial resolutions at field strengths of 3~T and above. Operating in this physiological noise dominated regime limits some benefits of high field acquisition since increases in image SNR produce only modest increases in time-course SNR. Although previous studies have shown that the physiological noise dominance can be mitigated by using higher spatial resolutions, not all functional studies require voxel sizes smaller than the thickness of the human cortex. In this study, we examine the effect of acquiring high spatial resolution, thermal noise dominated time-courses and spatially smoothing the images to lower resolutions, which would otherwise be physiological noise dominated. At high field strengths, where physiological noise is most problematic, this strategy lowered the overall time-course variance compared to direct acquisition at commonly used spatial resolution. At 7~T for example, 5~\texttimes ~5~\texttimes ~3~mm3 resolution images derived from smoothing 1.5~\texttimes ~1.5~\texttimes ~3~mm3 data improved time-course SNR by a factor of 1.89 compared to a time-series acquired at 5~\texttimes ~5~\texttimes ~3~mm3. Presumably, this effect was derived from the reduced physiological-to-thermal noise ratio in the high spatial resolution data followed by a smoothing operation that improves SNR without adding physiological noise. Our findings demonstrate that in contrast to conventional SNR penalties associated with spatially smoothing Fourier data, the time-course SNR of smoothed high-resolution data can be improved compared to direct acquisition at the desired resolution.},

In addition, a few studies have investigated a possible scale-free topology of the human brain, but the results of these studies have been inconclusive. These studies have mainly focused on inter-regional connectivity, representing the brain as a network of brain regions, requiring an arbitrary definition of such regions. However, using a voxel-wise approach allows for the model-free examination of both inter-regional as well as intra-regional connectivity and might reveal new information on network organization. Especially, a voxel-based study could give information about a possible scale-free organization of functional connectivity in the human brain. Resting-state 3~Tesla fMRI recordings of 28 healthy subjects were acquired and individual connectivity graphs were formed out of all cortical and sub-cortical voxels with connections reflecting inter-voxel functional connectivity. Graph characteristics from these connectivity networks were computed. The clustering-coefficient of these networks turned out to be much higher than the clustering-coefficient of comparable random graphs, together with a short average path length, indicating a small-world organization. Furthermore, the connectivity distribution of the number of inter-voxel connections followed a power-law scaling with an exponent close to 2, suggesting a scale-free network topology. Our findings suggest a combined small-world and scale-free organization of the functionally connected human brain. The results are interpreted as evidence for a highly efficient organization of the functionally connected brain, in which voxels are mostly connected with their direct neighbors forming clustered sub-networks, which are held together by a small number of highly connected hub-voxels that ensure a high level of overall connectivity.},

By studying statistics of residuals, we demonstrate that the technique suppresses local signal fluctuations that solely originate from thermal noise rather than from other sources such as anatomical detail.

  abstract = {The ability to distinguish existing memories from similar perceptual experiences is a core feature of episodic memory. This ability is often examined using the Mnemonic Similarity Task in which people discriminate memories of studied objects from perceptually similar lures. Studies of the neural basis of such mnemonic discrimination have mostly focused on hippocampal function and connectivity. However, default mode network (DMN) connectivity may also support such discrimination, given that the DMN includes the hippocampus, and its connectivity supports many aspects of episodic memory. Here, we used connectome-based predictive modeling to identify associations between intrinsic DMN connectivity and mnemonic discrimination. We leveraged a wide range of abilities across healthy younger and older adults to facilitate this predictive approach. Resting-state functional connectivity in the DMN predicted mnemonic discrimination outside the MRI scanner, especially among prefrontal and temporal regions and including several hippocampal regions. This predictive relationship was stronger for younger than older adults, primarily for temporalprefrontal connectivity. The novel associations established here are consistent with mounting evidence that broader cortical networks including the hippocampus support mnemonic discrimination. They also suggest that age-related network disruptions undermine the extent that the DMN supports this ability. This study provides the first indication of how intrinsic functional properties of the DMN support mnemonic discrimination.},

  abstract = {This work addresses the balance between temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) and partial volume effects (PVE) in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and investigates the impact of the choice of spatial resolution and smoothing. In fMRI, since physiological time courses are monitored, tSNR is of greater importance than image SNR. Improving SNR by an increase in voxel volume may be of negligible benefit when physiological fluctuations dominate the noise. Furthermore, at large voxel volumes, PVE are more pronounced, leading to an overall loss in performance. Artificial fMRI time series, based on high-resolution anatomical data, were used to simulate BOLD activation in a controlled manner. The performance was subsequently quantified as a measure of how well the resulted activation matched the simulated activation. The performance was highly dependent on the spatial resolution. At high contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), the optimal voxel volume was small, i.e. in the region of 23~mm3. It was also shown that using a substantially larger voxel volume in this case could potentially negate the CNR benefits. The optimal smoothing kernel width was dependent on the CNR, being larger at poor CNR. At CNR {$>$}1, little or no smoothing proved advantageous. The use of artificial time series gave an opportunity to quantitatively investigate the effects of partial volume and smoothing in single subject fMRI. It was shown that a proper choice of spatial resolution and smoothing kernel width is important for fMRI performance.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in accelerated imaging methods allow faster acquisition of high spatial resolution images. This could improve the applications of functional magnetic resonance imaging at 7 Tesla (7T-fMRI), such as neurosurgical planning and Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs). However, increasing the spatial and temporal resolution will both lead to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) losses due to decreased net magnetization per voxel and T1-relaxation effect, respectively. This could potentially offset the SNR efficiency gains made with increasing temporal resolution. We investigated the effects of varying spatial and temporal resolution on fMRI sensitivity measures and their implications on fMRI-based BCI simulations. We compared temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR), observed percent signal change (\%{$\increment$}S), volumes of significant activation, Z-scores and decoding performance of linear classifiers commonly used in BCIs across a range of spatial and temporal resolution images acquired during an ankle-tapping task. Our results revealed an average increase of 22\% in \%{$\increment$}S (p=0.006) and 9\% in decoding performance (p=0.015) with temporal resolution only at the highest spatial resolution of 1.5\texttimes 1.5\texttimes 1.5mm3, despite a 29\% decrease in tSNR (p{$<$}0.001) and plateaued Z-scores. Further, the volume of significant activation was indifferent (p{$>$}0.05) across spatial resolution specifically at the highest temporal resolution of 500ms. These results demonstrate that the overall BOLD sensitivity can be increased significantly with temporal resolution, granted an adequately high spatial resolution with minimal physiological noise level. This shows the feasibility of diffuse motor-network imaging at high spatial and temporal resolution with robust BOLD sensitivity with 7T-fMRI. Importantly, we show that this sensitivity improvement could be extended to an fMRI application such as BCIs.},
