# Magnetic Resonance in Medicine

## Article Types

- Research Article (Full Paper) (default type)
    - 5000 words, 10 total figures + tables
- Technical Notes
    - when scope is more limited in some way (vague)
    - 2800 words, 5 total figures + tables

Word count only includes the body of the text (and appendices, when present)
and not the title page, abstract, figure captions, tables, table captions, or
references

## Annoyances

- The Editorial Board recommends that for papers in which statistical data
  analysis methods are needed to reach conclusions (e.g., non proof-of-concept
  work relating to measurements in biological samples, animals, and humans), an
  estimate of the minimum sample size required to obtain statistically
  significant results be performed, and that the assumptions used in this
  analysis be explained. 
- Authors are allowed 30 days to submit a minor revision and 60 days for a
  major revision
- In this case, novelty of the Magn Reson Med submission will be assessed based
  on its incremental novelty over and beyond the prior publication.  For this
  purpose, a published Conference Paper (typically 4-8 pages in length) will be
  treated the same as other published papers. **A short abstract or poster
  displayed at a professional meeting, however, will generally not present a
  problem provided it is properly cited in the manuscript** and any necessary
  copyright permissions are obtained by the author(s)

### Formatting

14-page style guide.

- **Please prepare your manuscript text using MS Word (preferred method), Rich
  Text format, or LaTeX.**
- Formatting: Please use 1.5 line spacing throughout on 8 ½ by 11 inch or A4
  format with 1 inch margins on all sides and in a basic font (e.g., Arial,
  Helvetica, Verdana, Times New Roman) of at least 11 point throughout. All
  pages should be numbered consecutively, including references, tables, and
  figure legends. Manuscripts that fail to conform to the organization
  requirements may require resubmission, with the consequent loss of the
  earlier submission date.
- References should be prepared according to AMA Manual of Style



#### Structuring

Manuscripts should normally be divided into four sections with the headings:

- “Introduction,”
- “Methods”
- “Results”
- “Discussion”

A “Theory” section may be included after the Introduction, if a need exists. In
the Theory section, detailed mathematical derivations can be accommodated.
Alternatively, such derivations may be included in an Appendix

Subheadings are allowed, and their use is left to the discretion of authors.
Authors are encouraged to use subheadings in long papers, particularly in the
“Results” and “Discussion” sections. 

#### Figures

- To ensure adequate size, it is advisable to make data 3 mm high on a 5 x 7
  print and 6 mm high on an 8 ½ x 11 inch page. If it appears that the data
  would be too small after reduction, the figure will be returned to the author
  for modification. Images need to be cropped and all irrelevant parts removed.
- Avoid the use of thin lines (1-point or thinner), and remove manufacturer’s
  annotation on images. Crop images to minimize the area devoid of information.
  To facilitate review, figures may be embedded within the manuscript text but
  must also be uploaded as individual image files. The authors’ placement of
  figures within the text will have no bearing on the final production layout,
  should the paper be accepted.
- Do not shade the graph’s background area. 
- Images submitted must be in Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) or Encapsulated
  PostScript (EPS). Figures prepared in other formats such as Word, Excel or
  PowerPoint cannot be accepted. Failure to comply with these electronic
  submission procedures results in processing delays. All images should be
  saved and submitted in the following sizes or larger: single column = 20.5
  picas or 3.42 inches or 8.67 cm; 1.5 columns = 30.75 picas or 5.125 inches or
  13.02 cm; Double column = 41.5 picas or 6.92 inches or 17.56 cm. The entire
  page depth is 57 picas or 9.5 inches or 24.13 cm. All cropping and
  manipulation must be completed before the images are submitted.
- Figure files should be less than 20 megabytes in size in order to
  successfully convert for review through the ScholarOne Manuscripts submission
  system. Please include all the figure captions, in list format, at the end
  of your manuscript text file. Please do not include a figure caption within
  its electronic file. Instead, please upload each figure caption during the
  electronic submission process so that it will appear under the corresponding
  figure when the .pdf copy of the manuscript is rendered.

#### Other

Articles involving human subjects require a statement that the studies were
conducted with the approval of an Institutional Review Board (IRB) or analogous
Ethics Board.
