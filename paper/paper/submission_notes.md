# Overview

Our TMI article: ~6500 words (excl. refs and captions). I can't/won't use Microsoft Word
(due to my operating systems and costs), so any journal that requires Word and has no LaTeX option
is out (unless someone wants to handle tidying up a file I export from LibreOffice into Word).

## Medical Image Analysis (IF = 8.545)

- Annoyances
  - strongly suggest listing suggested reviewers
  - submission information re: manuscript length, etc. hidden / unclear
  - $4,170 OA publishing fee if not doing a "subescription only" pub (unclear who decides this)
- Minor Annoyances
  - figures will need re-doing
  - probably need LaTeX

##  Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (IF = 4.668)

- Annoyances
  - smaller allowed word count than current version

  - no annoying file format requirements
- Annoyances
  - non-negotiable Article Publishing Charge of $3,450 CAD billed upon acceptance of the manuscript

- Minor Annoyances
  - maybe some annoying IRB stuff that *should* be unneeded in this case:

    > If the study involves the re-analysis of previously published datasets (from the author or
    > other groups) or public/shared datasets, the ethics statement should describe both the
    > original ethical review as well as any further ethical review or data use agreement pertinent
    > to the submitted manuscript

## File Formats

- Journal Specific LaTeX TemplateTemplates are provided in order to allow
  authors to view their paper in a style close to the finalprinted form.The
  latex template can be found here.
- It is important that the file be saved in the native format of the
  wordprocessor used. The text shouldbe in single-column format. Keep the
  layout of the text as simple as possible. Most formatting codeswill be
  removed and replaced on processing the article. In particular, do not use the
  wordprocessor'soptions  to  justify text  or  to  hyphenate  words.
- However, do  use  bold  face,  italics, subscripts,superscripts etc. When
  preparing tables, if you are using a table grid, use only one grid for
  eachindividual table and not a grid for each row.  If no grid is used, use
  tabs, not spaces, to align columns.The electronic text should be prepared in
  a way very similar to that of conventional manuscripts (seealso the Guide to
  Publishing with Elsevier: https://www.elsevier.com/guidepublication).
- Supplementary material such as applications, images and sound clips, can be
  published with yourarticle to enhance it. Submitted supplementary items are
  published exactly as they are received (Excelor PowerPoint files will appear
  as such online).

## Annoyances

- Editable files (e.g., Word, LaTeX) are required to typeset your article
  for final publication.
- Please provide 3 to 5 names (with e-mail addresses) of potential reviewers
  with whom you have had no recent collaboration and no conflict of interest
  (during the last 5 years). Although not mandatory,neglecting this point often
  reveals a lack of knowledge in the field of research, and might slow downthe
  reviewing process.

### References

This journal encourages you to cite underlying or relevant datasets in your
manuscript by citing themin your text and including a data reference in your
Reference List. Data references should include thefollowing elements: author
name(s), dataset title, data repository, version (where available), year,and
global persistent identifier. Add [dataset] immediately before the reference so
we can properlyidentify it as a data reference. The [dataset] identifier will
not appear in your published article.








# Magnetic Resonance in Medicine

## Article Types

- Research Article (Full Paper) (default type)
    - 5000 words, 10 total figures + tables
- Technical Notes
    - when scope is more limited in some way (vague)
    - 2800 words, 5 total figures + tables

Word count only includes the body of the text (and appendices, when present)
and not the title page, abstract, figure captions, tables, table captions, or
references

## Annoyances

- The Editorial Board recommends that for papers in which statistical data
  analysis methods are needed to reach conclusions (e.g., non proof-of-concept
  work relating to measurements in biological samples, animals, and humans), an
  estimate of the minimum sample size required to obtain statistically
  significant results be performed, and that the assumptions used in this
  analysis be explained.
- Authors are allowed 30 days to submit a minor revision and 60 days for a
  major revision
- In this case, novelty of the Magn Reson Med submission will be assessed based
  on its incremental novelty over and beyond the prior publication.  For this
  purpose, a published Conference Paper (typically 4-8 pages in length) will be
  treated the same as other published papers. **A short abstract or poster
  displayed at a professional meeting, however, will generally not present a
  problem provided it is properly cited in the manuscript** and any necessary
  copyright permissions are obtained by the author(s)

### Formatting

14-page style guide.

- **Please prepare your manuscript text using MS Word (preferred method), Rich
  Text format, or LaTeX.**
- Formatting: Please use 1.5 line spacing throughout on 8 ½ by 11 inch or A4
  format with 1 inch margins on all sides and in a basic font (e.g., Arial,
  Helvetica, Verdana, Times New Roman) of at least 11 point throughout. All
  pages should be numbered consecutively, including references, tables, and
  figure legends. Manuscripts that fail to conform to the organization
  requirements may require resubmission, with the consequent loss of the
  earlier submission date.
- References should be prepared according to AMA Manual of Style



#### Structuring

Manuscripts should normally be divided into four sections with the headings:

- “Introduction,”
- “Methods”
- “Results”
- “Discussion”

A “Theory” section may be included after the Introduction, if a need exists. In
the Theory section, detailed mathematical derivations can be accommodated.
Alternatively, such derivations may be included in an Appendix

Subheadings are allowed, and their use is left to the discretion of authors.
Authors are encouraged to use subheadings in long papers, particularly in the
“Results” and “Discussion” sections.

#### Figures

- To ensure adequate size, it is advisable to make data 3 mm high on a 5 x 7
  print and 6 mm high on an 8 ½ x 11 inch page. If it appears that the data
  would be too small after reduction, the figure will be returned to the author
  for modification. Images need to be cropped and all irrelevant parts removed.
- Avoid the use of thin lines (1-point or thinner), and remove manufacturer’s
  annotation on images. Crop images to minimize the area devoid of information.
  To facilitate review, figures may be embedded within the manuscript text but
  must also be uploaded as individual image files. The authors’ placement of
  figures within the text will have no bearing on the final production layout,
  should the paper be accepted.
- Do not shade the graph’s background area.
- Images submitted must be in Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) or Encapsulated
  PostScript (EPS). Figures prepared in other formats such as Word, Excel or
  PowerPoint cannot be accepted. Failure to comply with these electronic
  submission procedures results in processing delays. All images should be
  saved and submitted in the following sizes or larger: single column = 20.5
  picas or 3.42 inches or 8.67 cm; 1.5 columns = 30.75 picas or 5.125 inches or
  13.02 cm; Double column = 41.5 picas or 6.92 inches or 17.56 cm. The entire
  page depth is 57 picas or 9.5 inches or 24.13 cm. All cropping and
  manipulation must be completed before the images are submitted.
- Figure files should be less than 20 megabytes in size in order to
  successfully convert for review through the ScholarOne Manuscripts submission
  system. Please include all the figure captions, in list format, at the end
  of your manuscript text file. Please do not include a figure caption within
  its electronic file. Instead, please upload each figure caption during the
  electronic submission process so that it will appear under the corresponding
  figure when the .pdf copy of the manuscript is rendered.

#### Other

Articles involving human subjects require a statement that the studies were
conducted with the approval of an Institutional Review Board (IRB) or analogous
Ethics Board.







# Network Neuroscience

## Submission General Instructions

- On first submission, **Network Neuroscience does not require any specific
  formatting, including formatting of references**. All articles are uploaded
  as a single pdf document with all elements of the article fully integrated
  (including figures, tables and references).
- LaTeX template provided later
- All articles should provide a list of Technical Terms which is uploaded as a
  separate document (pdf). This list should comprise around 10 key terms that
  are mentioned in the article and whose usage and definition may not be
  familiar across the broad readership of the journal. Authors should provide
  brief (20 words or less) definitions for each of these terms, avoiding in
  these definitions the use of jargon, or highly technical or specialized
  language. Technical Terms will appear in the margins of the article at or
  near their first mention in the text. Please upload Technical Terms as a
  separate file.

### Article Types

- Research
  - Principal article type in Network Neuroscience. Covers original
    research that is of broad interest and high significance to the field.
    Research articles must employ rigorous empirical and analytic methodology
    and provide substantial support for their conclusions. They should be
    written in a style that is accessible to a broad audience of scientists
    interested in neurobiological networks
  - no strict overall word limit, authors should aim for a maximum length of
    around 6000 words total (excluding references). The Introduction and
    Discussion sections may not exceed 800 and 1600 words, respectively. All
    non-essential material should be provided as Supplementary Materials.
- Methods
  - describe novel experimental or computational/analytic methods and tools
    that advance the goals of network neuroscience. Methods articles should
    provide detailed protocols for method implementation and strive to
    establish the validity of new methodologies. Authors of Methods articles
    are required to supply new materials, data and analytic tools covered in
    the article freely and openly to the scientific community.
  - the Introduction and Discussion sections are limited to 800 and 1600 words,
    respectively, and the total article length should not exceed 6000 words.
    Avoid reproducing code as part of the main text. Methods articles must
    include all essential materials needed to apply the method (full
    experimental procedures or software tools) as part of the Supplementary
    Materials or through a permanent link (URL or DOI) in a public repository
- Data
- Review
- Perspective

#### Research articles

We prefer that the Methods section be placed at the end of the manuscript
(after the Discussion). However, we will also accept articles that place the
Methods between the Introduction and the Results, if authors consider this
ordering to be more suitable for their manuscript. Research articles should
generally be arranged as follows:

1. Title/Authors/Affiliations/Contact Information/Keywords
2. Abstract
3. Author Summary (Research and Focus articles only)
4. Introduction
5. Results
6. Discussion
7. Materials and Methods (alternatively titled Methods, Models or Theory, as appropriate)
8. Acknowledgements
9. References

  than 350 characters). Please provide a short title (no more than 70
  characters) as well
- Prepare a list of at least 3 potential reviewers. Be sure to avoid conflicts
  of interest
- Be ready to enter author contributions, which are required for all Research,
  Methods, and Data Articles

## Instructions

> We now differentiate between the requirements for new and revised
> submissions. You may choose to submit your manuscript as a single Word or PDF
> file to be used in the refereeing process. Only when your paper is at the
> revision stage, will you be requested to put your paper in to a 'correct
> format' for acceptance and provide the items required for the publication of
> your article.

As part of the Your Paper Your Way service, you may choose to submit your
manuscript as a single file to be used in the refereeing process. This can be a
PDF file or a Word document, in any format or lay-out that can be used by
referees to evaluate your manuscript. It should contain high enough quality
figures for refereeing. If you prefer to do so, you may still provide all or
some of the source files at the initial submission. Please note that individual
figure files larger than 10 MB must be uploaded separately.

**In general submission format is very relaxed

### Other Annoyances

- If the study involves the re-analysis of previously published datasets (from
  the author or other groups) or public/shared datasets, the ethics statement should describe both the original ethical review as well as any further ethical review or data use agreement pertinent to the submitted manuscript.
- **Authors must state in their cover letter if a brief version of the study has
  been published as a conference proceeding.** In this case, the Authors should clarify the additional work that has been completed and added to the submitted full report. The proceeding paper must be available to the editorial team in order to judge the relative novelty and contribution of the full paper.
